## How can I convert a whole directory of files from Markdown to RTF?

On linux or OSX:

    for f in *.txt; do pandoc "$f" -s -o "${f%.txt}.rtf"; done

## I used pandoc to convert a document to ICML (or OPML or RTF), and when I try to open it in InDesign (or OmniOutliner or a word processor), I'm told it's invalid.  What have I done wrong?

Be sure to use the `-s` or `--standalone` flag, or you just get a
fragment, not a full document with the required header:

    pandoc -s -f markdown -t icml -o my.icml my.md

## I get a blank document when I try to convert a markdown document in Chinese to PDF

By default, pandoc uses pdflatex to generate the PDF, and pdflatex
doesn't handle Chinese characters. But you can change the default to
use xelatex instead. You should also make sure you're using a font
with Chinese glyphs.  For example:

    pandoc -o c.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex -V mainfont='Adobe Ming Std'

## The Windows installer does a single user install, rather than installing pandoc for all users. How can I install pandoc for all users?

Run the following command as admin:

    msiexec /i pandoc-VERSION.msi ALLUSERS=1

This will put pandoc in `C:\Program Files\Pandoc`.
You can install Pandoc to a different directory by setting APPLICATIONFOLDER parameter,
for example:

    msiexec /i pandoc-1.11.1.msi ALLUSERS=1 APPLICATIONFOLDER="C:\Pandoc"

## How do I change the margins in PDF output?

The option

    -V geometry:margin=1in

will set the margins to one inch on each side.  If you don't want uniform
margins, you can do something like

    -V geometry:"top=2cm, bottom=1.5cm, left=1cm, right=1cm"

Or

    -V geometry:"left=3cm, width=10cm"

For more options, see the documentation for the LaTeX [geometry
package](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/geometry).

## I get LaTeX errors when I add `\usepackage{titlesec}` in `header-includes`

Add

````
subparagraph: true
```

to your template.  The default template redefines `\paragraph`
in a way that is incompatible with titlesec, in order to make
all header levels appear as section headings.

## How does pandoc compare to multimarkdown?

Here is a [wiki
page](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/wiki/Pandoc-vs-Multimarkdown)
comparing the two.

## When I specify an image width of 50% and convert to LaTeX, pandoc sets the height to textheight and the aspect ratio isn't preserved. How can I prevent this?

For example, if you convert an image with `{width="50%"}`, the LaTeX produced
will be `\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height=\textheight]`.

This output presupposes the following code in pandoc's default latex
template:

```
% Scale images if necessary, so that they will not overflow the page
% margins by default, and it is still possible to overwrite the defaults
% using explicit options in \includegraphics[width, height, ...]{}
\setkeys{Gin}{width=\maxwidth,height=\maxheight,keepaspectratio}
```

If you don't have this in your custom template, you should
add it.  If we didn't set the `height` explicitly in this way,
the image would not be resized correctly unless it was
being resized to smaller than its original size.
