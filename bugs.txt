% Reporting bugs

Bug reports are welcome!
Please report all bugs on pandoc's github [issue tracker].
We are no longer using the googlecode issue tracker.

[issue tracker]: https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues

Guidelines:

1.  Before you submit a bug report, search the (open and closed)
    issues to make sure the issue hasn't come up before. Also,
    check the [User's Guide](README.html) for anything relevant.

2.  Make sure you can reproduce the bug with the latest released
    version of pandoc, and preferably with the development
    version.

3.  Your report should give detailed instructions for how to
    reproduce the problem.  A small test case (just a few lines)
    is ideal.
 
4.  If you're making an enhancement request, lay out the rationale
    for the feature you're requesting.  Why would this feature be
    useful?

5.  If you're not sure whether something is a bug, or want to discuss
    a potential new feature before putting in an enhancement request,
    [pandoc-discuss] is a good place to bring it up.

Submitting patches:

1.  Patches may be attached to issues or submitted to [pandoc-discuss].
    Each patch should make one logical change.

2.  Please follow the existing stylistic conventions (e.g. for if-then
    formatting), and wrap code to 80 columns.  Always include type
    signatures for top-level functions.

3.  Patches should be `-Wall` clean.

4.  If your patch is for a new writer or reader, please include test cases.
    (For a writer: `tests/writer.NAME`, `tests/tables.NAME`, and modify
    `tests/RunTests.hs` to run your tests).

5.  Before you put time into a nontrivial patch, it is worth discussing it
    on [pandoc-discuss].
