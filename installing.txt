% Installing

### Windows

  - There is a package installer at pandoc's [download page].
  - For PDF output, you'll also need to install LaTeX.
    We recommend [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/).

### Mac OS X

  - There is a package installer at pandoc's [download page].
    If you later want to uninstall the package, you can do so
    by downloading [this
    script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgm/pandoc/master/osx/uninstall-pandoc.pl)
    and running it with `perl uninstall-pandoc.pl`.
  - For PDF output, you'll also need LaTeX.  Because a full [MacTeX]
    installation takes more than a gigabyte of disk space, we recommend
    installing [BasicTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html)
    (64M), and using the `tlmgr` tool to install additional packages
    as needed.  If you get errors warning of fonts not found, try

        tlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended

### Linux

  - For 64-bit [Debian] and [Ubuntu], we provide a debian package
    on the [download page].  This will install the `pandoc` and
    `pandoc-citeproc` executables and man pages.  If you use
    an RPM-based distro, you may be able to install this deb using
    `alien`, or try

        ar p $DEB data.tar.gz | sudo tar xvz --strip-components 2 -C /usr/local

    where `$DEB` is the path to the downloaded deb.
  - Or, try your package manager.
    Pandoc is in the [Debian], [Ubuntu], [Slackware],
    [Arch], [Fedora], [NiXOS], [openSUSE], and [gentoo] repositories.
    Note, however, that versions in the repositories are often
    old.
  - If the version in your repository is too old and you cannot
    use the deb we provide, you can install from source, using the
    instructions below under [Installing from source].
    Note that most distros have the Haskell platform in their
    package repositories.  For example, on Debian/Ubuntu,
    you can install it with `apt-get install haskell-platform`.
  - For PDF output, you'll need LaTeX.  We recommend installing
    [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) via your package
    manager.  (On Debian/Ubuntu, `apt-get install texlive`.)

### BSD

  - Pandoc is in the [NetBSD] and [FreeBSD ports] repositories.

### Installing from source

If for some reason a binary package is not available for your
platform, you can install from source.

#### Getting the pandoc source code

Source tarballs can be found at
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc>.  For example, to
fetch the source for version 1.17.0.3:

    wget https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-1.17.0.3/pandoc-1.17.0.3.tar.gz
    tar xvzf pandoc-1.17.0.3.tar.gz
    cd pandoc-1.17.0.3

Or you can fetch the development code by cloning the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/jgm/pandoc
    cd pandoc
    git submodule update --init   # to fetch the templates

Note:  there may be times when the development code is broken
or depends on other libraries which must be installed
separately.  Unless you really know what you're doing, install
the last released version.

#### Building pandoc from source

The easiest approach is to use [stack]:

1.  Install [stack].

2.  Issue the following commands:

        stack setup
        stack install

    `stack setup` will automatically download the ghc compiler
    if you don't have it.  `stack install` will install the
    `pandoc` executable into `~/.local/bin`, which you should
    add to your `PATH`.  This process will take a while, and
    will consume a considerable amount of disk space.

Alternatively, you can follow the instructions in INSTALL,
included in the source.
