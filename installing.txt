% Installing

### Windows

  - There is a package installer at pandoc's [download page].
  - For PDF output, you'll also need to install LaTeX.
    We recommend [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/).

### Mac OS X

  - There is a package installer at pandoc's [download page].
    If you later want to uninstall the package, you can do so
    by downloading [this
    script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgm/pandoc/master/osx/uninstall-pandoc.pl)
    and running it with `perl uninstall-pandoc.pl`.
  - For PDF output, you'll also need LaTeX.  Because a full [MacTeX]
    installation takes more than a gigabyte of disk space, we recommend
    installing [BasicTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html)
    (64M), and using the `tlmgr` tool to install additional packages
    as needed.  If you get errors warning of fonts not found, try

        tlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended

### Linux

  - For 64-bit [Debian] and [Ubuntu], we provide a debian package
    on the [download page].  This will install the `pandoc` and
    `pandoc-citeproc` executables and man pages.  If you use
    an RPM-based distro, you may be able to install this deb using
    `alien`, or try

        ar p $DEB data.tar.gz | sudo tar xvz --strip-components 2 -C /usr/local

    where `$DEB` is the path to the downloaded deb.
  - Or, try your package manager.
    Pandoc is in the [Debian], [Ubuntu], [Slackware],
    [Arch], [Fedora], [NiXOS], [openSUSE], and [gentoo] repositories.
    Note, however, that versions in the repositories are often
    old.
  - If the version in your repository is too old and you cannot
    use the deb we provide, you can install from source, using the
    instructions below under [Installing from source].
    Note that most distros have the Haskell platform in their
    package repositories.  For example, on Debian/Ubuntu,
    you can install it with `apt-get install haskell-platform`.
  - For PDF output, you'll need LaTeX.  We recommend installing
    [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) via your package
    manager.  (On Debian/Ubuntu, `apt-get install texlive`.)

### BSD

  - Pandoc is in the [NetBSD] and [FreeBSD ports] repositories.

### Installing from source

If for some reason a binary package is not available for your
platform, you can install from source:

  - First, install the [Haskell platform], then use the
    `cabal` tool to get the latest release of pandoc:

        cabal update
        cabal install pandoc

    Or, if you want to use pandoc's citation processing features,

        cabal update
        cabal install pandoc pandoc-citeproc

    This will download and compile pandoc and all of its dependencies.

    If this step fails, and you're using an older version of the
    Haskell Platform (e.g. in Debian stable), try upgrading your
    `cabal` tool:

        cabal install cabal-install
        ~/.cabal/bin/cabal update
        ~/.cabal/bin/cabal install pandoc

    By default, cabal will perform a user install, putting the pandoc
    executable in `~/.cabal/bin` (on linux and BSD) or
    `~/Library/Haskell/bin` (on OS X).  Make sure this directory
    is in your path.

    To update pandoc when a new release comes out on HackageDB,
    simply do `cabal update && cabal install pandoc` again.  You
    may get a message saying that the install may break earlier
    installations of pandoc and pandoc-citeproc.  It should be safe
    to force the installation:

        cabal install --force pandoc pandoc-citeproc

  - Alternatively, you can download the [source tarball] and
    follow the instructions in INSTALL.

### Creating a relocatable binary

It is possible to compile pandoc such that the data files
pandoc uses are embedded in the binary. (The executables in
the binary are built this way.)  The
resulting binary can be run from any directory and is
completely self-contained.

     cabal update
     cabal install hsb2hs
     cabal install --flags="embed_data_files" pandoc pandoc-citeproc
