  location: |
    -   Shortfin squid inhabits the continental shelf and slope waters of
        the Northwest Atlantic Ocean, from Newfoundland to the central east
        coast of Florida.
    -   In the northwest Atlantic Ocean, shortfin squid are most often
        caught along the continental shelf break in depths between 150 to
        275 meters.
  color: |
    Raw squid is ivory colored with orange speckling and a brown stripe that
    runs down the mantle. Cooked squid is opaque white.

  habitat: |
    -   Shortfin squid live in deep and shallow waters on the continental
        shelf, continental slope, and open ocean depending on the season.
    -   They are found in nearshore waters of the Gulf of Maine during
        summer and fall.
    -   During spring, shortfin squid migrate onto the continental shelf,
        and during late fall, they migrate off the continental shelf.
    -   Their egg masses float in mid-water.
    -   Spawning occurs in the waters off Rhode Island and New Jersey.

    Squid are an excellent source of selenium, riboflavin, and vitamin B12.
  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery
        -   In 2018, commercial landings of shortfin squid totaled
            approximately 53 million pounds, and were valued at
            approximately $23.6 million.
        -   Fisheries for shortfin squid reflect the species’ seasonal
            migrations.
        -   The majority of landings come from Rhode Island and New Jersey.
        -   Harvested for bait domestically, and exported for bait and food.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   The majority of shortfin squid is harvested June 1 through
            October 31 using small-mesh bottom trawls. The fishery is open
            year round, but the squid aren’t available in commercial
            quantities year round.
        -   Sandy or muddy habitat, where squid are fished, is less
            sensitive to the impacts of trawling.
        -   Small-mesh bottom trawls can incidentally catch marine mammals
            and large pelagic species, including pilot whales, common
            dolphin, swordfish, and a variety of sharks, ray, and tuna
            species. Finfish such as butterfish, hakes, longfin squid,
            summer flounder, herring, spiny dogfish, and Atlantic mackerel
            are also incidentally caught in this fishery.
        -   Measures to prevent or minimize bycatch include:
            -   Fishing must occur seaward of the 50-fathom depth line to
                reduce finfish and longfin inshore squid bycatch.
            -   Outreach to fishermen to educate them on actions to take in
                the event of a marine mammal interaction.
            -   Real-time communication to vessels regarding hotspots of
                marine mammal interactions.

        -   Fishermen with a limited access permit can fish for unlimited
            amounts of shortfin squid while the fishery is open. All other
            fishermen must obtain an incidental catch permit, and have
            possession limits.
        -   An annual coastwide catch quota is set annually. Managers
            monitor annual quotas closely, as there can be large
            fluctuations in abundance from year to year.

  biology: |
    -   Shortfin squid live for less than one year. They have a high natural
        mortality rate, and a long spawning season.
    -   Females can release multiple egg masses during a single spawning
        season, but die after they spawn. Spawning can occur year round with
        seasonal peaks from October to June.
    -   Shortfin squid have extremely variable birth, growth, and maturity
        rates. This makes them extremely sensitive to climate-driven
        changes. 
    -   They grow about one millimeter a day.
    -   Shortfin squid are visual predators that eat crustaceans, fish, and
        other squid, including their own species.
    -   They are food for many fish, including [bluefin

        Seabird predators include shearwaters, gannets, and fulmars.
    -   Shortfin squid undergo daily vertical migrations between cooler deep
        water and warmer surface water. They are nearest the seabed during
        the day, and higher in the water column during the night.

    -   American lobster is a crustacean with a large shrimp-like body and
        10 legs, two of which are large, strong claws.

    &nbsp;

    -   One claw is a big-toothed crusher claw for pulverizing shells, and
        the other is a finer-edged ripper claw, resembling a steak knife,
        for tearing soft flesh.

    &nbsp;

    -   [Male and female
        lobsters](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/regs/infodocs/lobster_sex_id.pdf)
        can be distinguished by the first pair of swimmerets (pleopods) on
        the upper portion of the underside of the tail. The male swimmerets
        are larger and more rigid. The female swimmerets are softer,
        smaller, and have rounded edges.

    &nbsp;

    -   Live lobsters are not red like those you see in a restaurant or
        grocery store, after they have been cooked. Most are either
        olive-green or greenish-brown. Some have orange, reddish, dark
        green, or black speckles and bluish colors in the joints of their
        appendages.
  human_health:
  texture: The meat is firm and somewhat fibrous. The tail meat is firmer than the
    meat from the claws.

        from Maine through New Jersey, and are also common offshore to
        depths of 2,300 feet from Maine through North Carolina.

  habitat: |
    -   American lobsters live on the ocean floor.

    &nbsp;

    -   They live alone and are very territorial.

    &nbsp;

    -   They can live in a variety of habitats as long as there is a burrow
        or crevice for cover.

    &nbsp;

    -   Coastal lobsters like rocky areas where they can readily find
        shelter, although they’re sometimes found in mud bottoms where they
        can burrow.

    &nbsp;

    -   Offshore populations are most abundant along the edge of the
        continental shelf near underwater canyons.

    &nbsp;

    -   Near the coast, small lobsters do not travel much, but larger ones
        may travel extensively. Offshore lobsters migrate during the spring
        anywhere from 50 to 190 miles.

    &nbsp;

    -   Scientists, managers, and fishermen are concerned about the habitat
        conditions for American lobster in inshore Southern New England
        waters, particularly in Long Island Sound. Scientists believe that a
        combination of warmer water temperatures, hypoxia (low dissolved
        oxygen levels), and other stress factors resulted in lobster
        die-offs in western Long Island Sound in late 1999 and in 2002. If
        these conditions continue, future die-offs are possible. Researchers
        also believe that increased water temperatures in Southern New
        England may be driving lobsters to cooler offshore waters and
        disrupting the settlement of larvae in traditional coastal areas.

  research: |
    -   State scientists, in cooperation with the lobster industry, are
        conducting projects to assist with the effective management of the
        lobster resource. Many states have established [ventless trap
        survey](http://www.asmfc.org/fisheries-science/surveys)s to quantify
        the abundance of juvenile lobsters. By removing escape vents from
        the lobster traps and randomly placing those traps within certain
        depth categories and geographic areas, researchers can assess the
        abundance of juvenile lobsters and the potential for young lobsters
        to reach a size or life stage that can be caught by the fishing gear
        (recruitment) in the future. These surveys complement longstanding
        fishery-independent bottom trawl surveys conducted by NOAA Fisheries
        and the states. Because trawl gear cannot effectively sample rocky
        or shallow coastal bottom types, the ventless trap surveys attempt
        to fill this data gap by using fixed lobster gear without escape
        vents.

    [advises](https://www.fda.gov/downloads/food/guidanceregulation/ucm252395.pdf)
    consumers to not eat the tomalley, the light-green substance found in
    the lobster.
  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   In 2017, commercial landings of American lobster totaled 136.7
            million pounds and were valued at more than $566.5 million.
        -   The two stocks of American lobster—Gulf of Maine and Georges
            Bank, and Southern New England—support both inshore and offshore
            fisheries. The Gulf of Maine and Southern New England areas are
            predominantly inshore fisheries, while the Georges Bank area is
            predominantly an offshore fishery. Most U.S. harvest is caught
            in inshore waters.
        -   There’s a reason we associate Maine with lobsters—the state has
            led American lobster landings for over 3 decades. Massachusetts
            is the second leading producer. Together, these two states
            produce 94 percent of the total U.S. American lobster harvest,
            and 94 percent of the coast-wide landings come from the Gulf of
            Maine lobster stock.

    &nbsp;

    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Most fishermen use traps to harvest lobster. They bait
            rectangular, wire-mesh traps then lower them to the ocean floor
            in water 15 to 1,000 feet deep. A buoy that marks the trap’s
            location is attached to the trap line. Fishermen haul the traps
            back to the surface every few days to check their catch,
            although the frequency varies depending on the season and the
            location.
        -   The Northeast/Mid-Atlantic American lobster trap/pot fishery can
            incidentally entangle large whales. To reduce injuries and
            deaths of large whales due to fisheries interactions, the
            [Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction
            Plan](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/Protected/whaletrp/)
            was implemented in 1997. Lobstermen must follow a number of
            regulations to protect large whales from fishing gear. For
            example, lobstermen must use sinking groundlines between traps
            to reduce the amount of line in the water column, which reduces
            the potential for whales and other protected species to become
            entangled. In addition, lobster permit holders are required to
            haul their active traps at least once every 30 days.
        -   Traps can incidentally catch finfish and invertebrates (such as
            crabs and conch). Regulations require traps to be configured
            with biodegradable escape panels or hinges on traps to prevent
            ghost fishing (lost gear that continues to capture lobster and
            other species and may pose a hazard to other marine species).
            Escape panels must be large enough to reduce bycatch of
            undersized lobsters.

    &nbsp;

    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Recreational fishermen catch lobsters in coastal waters with
            pots and by hand while scuba diving. Recreational fishermen with
            a federal lobster permit may harvest lobster in federal waters,
            but the lobster cannot be sold.

        cooperatively manage the American lobster resource and fishery under
        the framework of the [Atlantic States Marine Fisheries
        Commission](http://www.asmfc.org/) (ASMFC).

    &nbsp;

    -   Each lobster harvesting state has three members on the ASMFC lobster
        management board, and NOAA Fisheries has one representative on the
        board. Each state, and NOAA Fisheries, has one vote when
        deliberating management measures for American lobster. The
        management board looks to industry advisors to provide
        recommendations for managing the fishery to meet management
        objectives.

    &nbsp;

    -   States have jurisdiction for implementing measures in state waters
        (within 3 miles of shore), while [NOAA
        Fisheries](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/sustainable/species/lobster/)
        implements complementary regulations for the American lobster
        fishery in offshore federal waters (3 to 200 miles from shore).

    &nbsp;

    -   The American lobster’s range is divided into [two stock areas and
        seven management
        areas](http://www.asmfc.org/uploads/file/58f8cd9aLobsterManagement_StockArea_Map_Nov2016.JPG).
        There are seven Lobster Conservation Management Teams, one for each
        management area. These teams, made up of industry representatives,
        recommend measures to address the specific needs in their respective
        management areas. Federal waters contain portions of six of the
        seven management areas. Only Area 6 is totally within state waters
        (Long Island Sound, which consists of New York and Connecticut state
        waters).

    &nbsp;

    -   Managed in state waters (within 3 miles of shore) under the
        [Interstate Fishery Management Plan for American
        Lobster](http://www.asmfc.org/species/american-lobster). Each
        management area has unique regulations that include:
        -   Limits on the minimum and maximum size of lobster than can be
            harvested.
        -   Trap limits control fishing effort. Each lobster vessel is
            limited to either a vessel-based trap allocation based on its
            historical fishing practices, or an area-wide trap cap (the
            maximum number of traps a vessel may fish in a specific area). 
        -   Measures to protect egg-bearing females—fishermen may not
            harvest them and, in most areas, if one is caught in their trap,
            they must notch its tail fin in a “v” shape before returning it
            to the water.
        -   Prohibition on possession of lobster meat and lobster parts
            (lobsters must be landed live and whole to ensure they are of
            legal size).
        -   Gear restrictions, trap configuration requirements, and
            prohibition on using spears to fish for lobsters.
        -   Restrictions on the amount of lobster that can be harvested with
            non-trap gear.
        -   Monitoring and reporting requirements.
        -   A series of annual trap reductions are underway in lobster
            management areas 2 and 3 to reduce both latent and active effort
            and scale the Southern New England lobster fishery to the size
            of the stock.
        -   A [trap transfer
            program](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/nr/2017/July/17lobttpgphl.pdf)
            was initiated in 2015 that allows Federal permit holders to
            mitigate the impacts of the annual trap reductions by purchasing
            partial trap allocation from other authorized permit holders. 
            Others may sell allocation to other Federal lobster permit
            holders to downsize their own fishing operations and allow other
            permit holders to gain access to the trap fishery in certain
            management areas.

    &nbsp;

    -   Managed in federal waters (3 to 200 miles offshore) under
        regulations implemented through the [Atlantic Coastal Fisheries

        Act](http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/management/state_federal/documents/acfcma.pdf),
        including:
        -   Fishermen must have a permit to harvest lobster. A temporary
            moratorium on the issuance of federal lobster permits, which
            limits the amount of available permits to control the number of
            fishermen harvesting lobster, was extended indefinitely in 1999.
        -   Limits on the minimum and maximum size of lobsters that can be
            harvested, which varies by management area.
        -   Prohibition on possession of lobster meat and lobster parts
            (lobsters must be landed live and whole to ensure they are of
            legal size).
        -   Measures to protect egg-bearing females—fishermen may not
            harvest them and, in most areas, if one is caught in their trap,
            they must notch its tail fin in a “v” shape before returning it
            to the water.
        -   Gear restrictions (trap size, gear marking requirements, escape
            vents, and ghost panels).
        -   Trap limits, which vary among management areas.
        -   To improve data collection in the fishery, all federal lobster
            dealers must submit weekly electronic reports for all lobsters
            they purchase from fishermen with federal permits. Federal
            lobster permit holders are not required to report landings
            unless they have another Federal fishery permit, in addition to
            their Federal lobster permit, that  requires landings reports
            (e.g., Northeast multispecies permit).
        -   Area-specific measures have been approved to reduce fishing
            exploitation on the Southern New England stock, including
            biological and effort control management measures.
        -   Regulations require biodegradable escape panels or hinges on
            traps to prevent ghost fishing (when lost gear continues to
            capture lobster and other species). Escape panels must be large
            enough to reduce bycatch of undersized lobsters.​

    -   American lobsters have a long life span. It’s difficult to determine
        their exact age because they shed their hard shell when they molt,
        leaving no evidence of age. But scientists believe some American
        lobsters may live to be 100 years old.

    &nbsp;

    -   They can weigh up to 44 pounds.

    &nbsp;

    -   Lobsters must periodically molt in order to grow, shedding their
        hard, external skeleton (shell) when they grow too large for it and
        forming a new one. They eat voraciously after they molt, often
        devouring their own recently vacated shells. Eating their shell
        replenishes lost calcium and helps harden their new shell.

    &nbsp;

    -   Lobsters molt about 20 to 25 times over a period of 5 to 8 years
        between the time they hatch and when they are able to reproduce and
        reach the minimum legal size to be harvested.

    &nbsp;

    -   Usually, lobsters mate after the females molt. Males deposit sperm
        in the soft-shelled females. The female stores the sperm internally
        for up to a year.

    &nbsp;

    -   Females can have 5,000 to more than 100,000 eggs, depending on their
        size. The eggs are fertilized as females release them on the
        underside of their tails, where they carry the eggs for 9 to 11
        months.

    &nbsp;

    -   Egg-bearing females move inshore to hatch their eggs during late
        spring or early summer.

    &nbsp;

    -   The pelagic (free-swimming) larvae molt four times before they
        resemble adults and settle to the bottom.

    &nbsp;

    -   Lobsters are opportunistic feeders, feeding on whatever prey is most
        available, so their diet varies regionally.

    &nbsp;

    -   Larvae and postlarvae are carnivorous and eat zooplankton (tiny
        floating animals) during their first year.

    &nbsp;

    -   Adults are omnivorous, feeding on crabs, mollusks, worms, sea
        urchins, sea stars, fish, and macroalgae.

    &nbsp;

    -   In general, a variety of bottom-dwelling species feed on lobster,
        including fish, sharks, rays, skates, octopuses, and crabs. Young
        lobsters are especially vulnerable to predators. Large, hard-shelled
        lobsters may be immune to predators (except humans).

        -   In 2017, commercial landings of yellowtail rockfish totaled more
            than 6.3 million pounds and were valued at more than $1.8
            million. The majority of landings are in Oregon and Washington.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Primarily harvested with midwater trawl gear, which has minimal
            impacts on ocean bottom habitats. To a lesser extent, harvested
            with bottom trawl gear.
        -   Midwater and bottom trawls may sometimes catch other species of
            fish, including overfished and protected species.
            -   Gear restrictions, closed areas, and catch share programs
                limit when, where, and how much trawl fishermen can harvest
                to reduce bycatch of other species.
            -   [Rockfish conservation

                These closed areas help prevent bycatch of overfished
                rockfish.
        -   Yellowtail rockfish are often caught incidentally in the

        -   Provisions that allow fishermen to decide how and when to catch
            their share.
        -   Yellowtail rockfish have been underutilized. The recent harvest
            rule changes to the catch share program will allow increased
            catches of underutilized species, such as yellowtail and
            chilipepper rockfish,

            [Pacific cod](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/pacific-cod).
            These changes were possible because of improvements observed in
            other stocks that had previously constrained the harvest of fish
            like yellowtail rockfish due to low population levels.
    -   [NOAA Fisheries](https://alaskafisheries.noaa.gov/) and the [North

    -   Larvae and young-of-the-year bocaccio live in the upper layers of
        the ocean for several months.
    -   Juveniles settle nearshore in bottom habitats, such as rocky areas
        or kelp forests, and form schools.
    -   As juveniles mature, they move offshore to greater depths.
    -   Adult bocaccio primarily inhabit rocky habitats from 130 to 980 feet
        deep. They also live on coral and sponge reefs, and even artificial
        structures such as oil platforms.
    -   Several sources describe bocaccio as a midwater species during at

  biology: |
    -   Bocaccio is a species of rockfish. Rockfishes are unusual among the
        bony fishes in that fertilization and embryo development is internal
        and female rockfish give birth to live larval young.
    -   Like most other species of rockfish, bocaccio are long-lived.
        Bocaccio mature and begin to reproduce between ages 4 and 7 years
        old, and they can live to be 50 years old.
    -   Bocaccio larvae are opportunistic feeders. Early on, larvae mostly
        eat copepod nauplii and eat some invertebrate eggs. As they grow,
        larvae start eating copepodites, adult copepods, and euphausiids.
    -   Within the first year of their lives, bocaccio begin foraging on
        other young fishes.
    -   Adult bocaccio mostly eat fish. Their preferred meal is other
        rockfishes, but they will also eat
        [sablefish](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/sablefish),
        anchovies, lantern fish and squid.
    -   Female bocaccio may spawn one to three times per season. They are
        highly fecund for rockfish and have been recorded with anywhere from
        290 thousand up to 1.9 million eggs in the ovaries at one time.
    -   In the Southern California Bight, Bocaccio spawn from October to
        July, peaking in January. Off central and northern California,
        Bocaccio spawn from January to May and peak in February.

    -   Scientists at NOAA’s [Northeast Fisheries Science
        Center](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/) conduct research bottom trawl
        surveys throughout the Northeast continental shelf every year during
        the fall and spring. These surveys collect data on the environment
        as well as biological samples from fish caught during research
        trawling. The data from these and other sources are used by
        scientists in stock assessments to estimate population size and
        fishing pressure.

  health_benefits: |
    Halibut is low in saturated fat and sodium, and is a very good source of
    protein, niacin, phosphorus, and selenium.
  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   In 2017, commercial landings of Atlantic halibut totaled 242,105
            pounds and were valued at more than $1.4 million.
        -   Regulations include a minimum fish size and a limit of one fish
            per vessel per trip in federal waters.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Halibut are commonly harvested using trawl nets, bottom
            longlines, and rod and reel.
        -   Trawl gear used to harvest halibut can impact habitat, depending
            on where they are used. Trawl gear can incidentally catch other
            fish and marine mammals.
        -   Longlines, and rod and reel used to harvest halibut have little
            to no impact on habitat.
        -   Regulations close key areas to fishing year-round or seasonally
            to protect habitat and spawning aggregations.
        -   Restrictions on the size of gear that makes contact with the
            bottom in certain areas also help reduce habitat impacts.
        -   Fishermen follow a number of strict regulations and use modified
            fishing gear to reduce bycatch of other species.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Halibut are sometimes targeted by recreational anglers, but are
            most often encountered when targeting other groundfish species
            like cod and haddock.
        -   [Regulations](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/sustainable/recfishing/regs/index.html)
            include a minimum fish size and a limit of one fish per vessel

    -   Atlantic halibut is the largest species of flatfish in the world.
    -   Atlantic halibut can reach up to 15 feet in length
    -   The largest Atlantic halibut recorded was taken off Cape Ann,
        Massachusetts, and weighed 615 pounds (eviscerated with the head
        still attached). It likely weighed 700 pounds when it was alive.
    -   It is a long-lived, late-maturing species that can live up to 50
        years.
    -   Average age at maturity is about 10 years.
    -   Full grown females average 100 to 150 pounds, while males tend to be
        smaller.
    -   Females are batch spawners, producing several batches of eggs each
        year.
    -   In Canadian waters, Atlantic halibut spawn from late winter to early
        spring, while spawning can last through September for fish from
        Georges Bank to the Grand Banks.
    -   Halibut food preferences vary by fish size: smaller fish (up to 12
        inches in length) feed almost exclusively on invertebrates. The
        proportion of fish in the diet increases as the fish grow in size
        until they feed almost exclusively on fishes when they reach
        approximately 31 inches.

            closures and gear restrictions protect sensitive rocky,
            cold-water coral and sponge habitats from bottom trawl gear.
        -   In the Gulf of Alaska, they are mainly caught with trawl and
            longline gear as bycatch in the rockfish and sablefish
            fisheries. On the Pacific Coast, they are targeted in the
            rockfish fishery with bottom trawl, longline, and pot gear.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Thornyheads are occasionally caught in recreational fisheries
            but are not often targeted, due to the complications of deep-sea
            fishing.

  habitat_impacts: |
    Most fishing gear used to harvest canary rockfish rarely contacts the
    ocean floor and has minimal impacts on habitat. Area closures and gear
    restrictions protect sensitive rocky, cold-water coral and sponge
    habitats from bottom trawl gear.
  location: |
    -   Canary rockfish are found between Punta Colnett, Baja California,
        and the Western Gulf of Alaska. Within this range, canary rockfish
        are most common off the coast of central Oregon.
  color: |
    Raw flesh varies from light pink or translucent, to pink, to red, and
    turns white when cooked.

  habitat: |
    -   Canary rockfish primarily inhabit waters 160 to 820 feet deep but
        may be found to 1400 feet.
    -   Larvae are found in surface waters and may be distributed over a
        wide area extending several hundred miles offshore.
    -   Larvae and small juvenile rockfish may remain in open waters for
        several months, being passively dispersed by ocean currents.
    -   Juveniles and subadults tend to be more common than adults in
        shallow water and are associated with rocky reefs, kelp canopies,
        and artificial structures, such as piers and oil platforms.
    -   Adults generally move into deeper water as they increase in size and
        age but usually exhibit strong site fidelity to rocky bottoms and
        outcrops where they hover in loose groups just above the bottom.

    -   Between 2014-2016, charter boat captains and volunteer anglers
        collected 100 rare rockfish in the Puget Sound region. Three species
        had been listed as threatened or endangered, and NOAA looked to
        local ecological knowledge for the scientific sampling required for
        recovery. Genetic analyses from these fishing trips provided new
        information, contributed to the [delisting of canary

    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   In 2016, commercial landings of canary rockfish totaled 54,737
            pounds and were valued at $ 27,144. The majority of landings are
            in Oregon and Washington.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Primarily harvested with midwater trawl gear, which has minimal
            impacts on ocean bottom habitats. To a lesser extent, harvested
            with bottom trawl gear.
        -   Midwater and bottom trawls may sometimes catch other species of
            fish, including overfished and protected species.
            -   Gear restrictions, closed areas, and catch share programs
                limit when, where, and how much trawl fishermen can harvest
                to reduce bycatch of other species.
            -   [Rockfish conservation
                areas](http://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/fisheries/management/groundfish_closures/rockfish_areas.html)
                eliminate fishing in areas on the West Coast where
                overfished rockfish species co-occur with target stocks,
                like canary rockfish. These closed areas help prevent
                bycatch of overfished rockfish.
        -   Canary rockfish are often caught incidentally in the Pacific
            whiting fishery.
            -   Managers are working to reduce incidental catch through the
                use of annual catch limits and catch shares.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Recreational anglers fish for canary rockfish, but they comprise
            only a minor part of recreational groundfish fisheries.

            their share.
    -   Prior to the canary rockfish stock rebuilding, fishing for other
        species like Dover sole and black cod was limited by canary rockfish
        catch limits. Now that the canary rockfish stock has rebuilt,
        fishermen can catch and land more of all these species.

    -   Canary rockfish are large rockfish that reach up to 2.5 feet in
        length and 10 pounds.
    -   They can live up to 75 years.
    -   Approximately 50 percent of adult canary rockfish are mature at 14
        inches total length (about 5 to 6 years of age).
    -   Rockfishes are unusual among the bony fishes in that fertilization
        and embryo development is internal and female rockfish give birth to
        live larval young.
    -   Female can have 260,000 to 1.9 million eggs, considerably more than
        many other rockfish species.
    -   Larval rockfish feed on diatoms, dinoflagellates, tintinnids, and
        cladocerans.
    -   Juveniles consume copepods and euphausiids of all life stages.
    -   Adults eat demersal invertebrates and small fishes, including other
        species of rockfish.

  habitat: |
    -   Juvenile black grouper can occur in seagrass and oyster rubble
        habitat in the Carolinas, and along reefs in the Florida Keys and in
        Brazil.
    -   Adults prefer rocky bottoms, drop-off walls and ledges, caves,
        crevices, and coral and artificial reefs.
    -   Black grouper are relatively sedentary and can remain in one
        particular site for some time.
    -   They move to progressively deeper waters as they age.
    -   They are found inshore up to depths of 656 feet (200 meters).
    -   Adults are solitary, but in some instances form small groups.
    -   Adults make seasonal migrations to spawning sites where they form
        large spawning aggregations.

    Grouper is low in saturated fat. It is a good source of vitamins B6 and
    B12, phosphorus, potassium, protein and selenium. More information on
    [health and seafood](https://www.fishwatch.gov/eating-seafood/health).
  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   In 2016, commercial landings of black grouper totaled 123,526
            pounds and were valued at $530,408. Landings are primarily from
            the South Atlantic. There are limited landings in the U.S.
            Caribbean.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Commercial fishermen mainly use hook-and-line gear, including
            longlines and handlines, to harvest black grouper.
        -   Trawl gear, fish traps, and bottom longlines are prohibited in
            some areas to reduce bycatch. Several areas are closed to all
            fishing to protect snappers and groupers, including black
            grouper.
        -   Sea turtles and other reef fishes, such as snappers and
            groupers, can be incidentally caught while fishing for black
            grouper.
        -   In certain areas, fishermen are required to use circle hooks to
            improve the chance of survival of any unintentionally caught
            fish and to reduce turtle hookings.
        -   Commercial and charterboat/headboat reef fish fishermen must use
            appropriate release gear and follow handling protocols to
            increase the chance of survival for any incidentally caught [sea
            turtles](http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/sustainable_fisheries/gulf_sa/turtle_sawfish_release/index.html).
        -   Fishermen are encouraged to use [venting
            tools](https://www.flseagrant.org/fisheries/venting/) or [fish
            descenders](http://catchandrelease.org/descending-and-venting.html)
            when fish are caught showing signs of barotrauma. Barotrauma
            occurs when reef fish are quickly brought to the surface by
            hook-and-line and the gas in their swim bladders expands.
            [Venting tools](https://www.flseagrant.org/fisheries/venting/)
            help deflate the expanded abdominal cavity, potentially reduce
            injury to the fish, and make it easier to return to deep water.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Black grouper is a popular fish among recreational fishermen in
            the South Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean.
        -   In the South Atlantic:
            -   Annual catch limits and accountability measures.
            -   Bag and size limits.
            -   The fishery is closed during the spawning season (from
                January through April).
        -   In the Gulf of Mexico:
            -   Annual catch limits and accountability measures.
            -   Bag and size limits.
            -   The fishery is closed during the spawning season (from
                February 1 through March 31) in deep water (greater than 120
                feet) to protect spawning aggregations.
        -   In the U.S. Caribbean:
            -   Annual catch limits
            -   Seasonal closure for black, red, tiger, yellowfin, and
                yellowedge groupers from February 1 through April 30.

        -   Annual catch limits are used for black grouper in the commercial
            and recreational fisheries. These fisheries are closed when
            their annual catch limit is projected to be met.
        -   Both the commercial and recreational fisheries have size limits
            to reduce harvest of immature black grouper.
        -   The commercial and recreational fishing seasons are closed from

        -   Commercial vessels must have a reef fish permit and individual
            fishing quota (IFQ) allocation to harvest black grouper.
        -   Black grouper is part of the Other Shallow-Water Grouper catch
            share category in the IFQ program.
        -   The annual catch limit is allocated between the commercial (76
            percent) and recreational (24 percent) fisheries.
        -   The IFQ program ([catch
            shares](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/laws-and-policies/catch-shares))
            allocates the commercial catch limit among shareholders with
            measures to prevent fishermen from harvesting more than their
            individual allocation.
        -   To reduce bycatch, there are restrictions on the type of gear
            fishermen may use and where they can fish.
        -   Minimum size limits protect immature black grouper.
        -   Year-round and/or seasonal area closures for commercial and
            recreational sectors to protect spawning groupers.
        -   Commercial data reporting requirements.
    -   In the U.S. Caribbean, managed under the [Reef Fish Fishery
        Management
        Plan](https://www.caribbeanfmc.com/fishery-management/fishery-management-plans):
        -   Annual catch limits. All groupers are managed as a single block
            throughout the U.S. Caribbean. Groupers are managed separately
            by commercial and recreational sector in Puerto Rico.
        -   Seasonal closure for black, red, tiger, yellowfin, and
            yellowedge groupers from February 1 through April 30.

    -   Black grouper grow up to five feet long and can weigh up to 180
        pounds.
    -   They can live up to 30 years old.
    -   They begin life as a female and some change into males as they grow
        – usually between two and four feet in length or 11 and 14 years
        old.
    -   The overall sex ratio is generally one male for every four females.
    -   Black grouper are solitary fish until spawning season, May through
        August, where they aggregate and spawn in huge numbers.
    -   Eggs are fertilized externally, and float with the currents.
    -   Young black grouper feed on crustaceans, mostly shrimp.
    -   Adults feed on other fish and squid.
    -   Black grouper have large, powerful jaws that they use to ambush
        their prey.
    -   They do not have teeth, and instead use their mouth and gills to
        suck up their prey.
    -   They also have teeth plates inside their throat that prevent prey
        from escaping after being swallowed.
    -   Black grouper take advantage of other species’ reproductive
        aggregations for feeding.
    -   Sharks prey upon large black grouper, while other grouper and moray
        eels prey upon smaller ones.

  bycatch: |
    Regulations are in place to minimize bycatch. Striped marlin are caught
    incidentally in some fisheries that target tunas and swordfish.
  availability: |
    Striped marlin is caught year-round, but the majority is caught between
    November and June.
  research: |
    -   Researchers at Stanford University and the International Game Fish
        Association are investigating the movements of marlin through the
        [Great Marlin Race](http://igmr.igfa.org/Conserve/IGMR.aspx).
    -   The [Global Tagging of Pelagic Predators](http://www.gtopp.org/)
        program is an international collaborative effort that tracks the
        location of predators (such as marlin and sharks) in the ocean to
        better understand how to protect these pelagic animals.
    -   [University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Large Pelagics Research
        Center](https://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/pacific-wide-study-reveals-striped-marlins)
        collaborated with the University of Southern California and the
        Conservation Science Institute of Waikoloa, Hawaii, to investigate
        the vertical habitat of striped marlin.

  taste: |
    Distinctive flavor similar to but more pronounced than swordfish. It is
    considered the finest eating of all marlin species.
  health_benefits: |
    Striped marlin is an excellent source of extra-lean protein. It is low
    in saturated fat and sodium. It is rich in niacin, vitamins B6 and B12,
    phosphorus, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids.
  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   In 2017, commercial landings of Pacific striped marlin totaled
            more than 1 million pounds and were valued at more than
            $1.6 million.
        -   The [Billfish Conservation
            Act](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr2706/text),
            along with existing billfish regulations, prohibits the sale and
            commercial possession of billfish and billfish products.
            However, those that are caught in Hawaii and the Pacific Insular
            Areas (which includes American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern
            Mariana Islands) are exempt and can be sold.
        -   Prohibitions on the sale of striped marlin on the U.S. West
            Coast provide a strong disincentive for commercial fishermen to
            catch striped marlin.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Marlin are primarily caught incidentally in pelagic longline
            commercial fisheries for tuna and swordfish.
        -   U.S. pelagic longline fishermen, who target tuna and swordfish
            and may incidentally catch striped marlin, are required to use
            specific tools and handling techniques to mitigate bycatch of
            sea turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals. The Hawaii longline
            regulation summary can be found
            [here](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/hawaii-pelagic-longline-regulation-summary).
        -   If too many interactions with sea turtles occur, NOAA Fisheries
            closes the fishery for the remainder of the year.
        -   To prevent seabird interactions, deep and shallow-set longline
            vessels must either deploy longline gear from the side of the
            vessel (as opposed to the back of the vessel) or use blue-dyed
            bait (which is less visible to seabirds).
        -   In the deep-set longline sector, vessels must use circle hooks
            and certain gear setups to allow whales to bend the hooks and
            escape an incidental hooking.
        -   Time-area closures also limit and prevent interactions between
            pelagic longline gear and non-target species.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Striped marlin are a favorite target for recreational fishermen
            and one of the most sought-after billfish in the region because
            the fish are acrobatic and tend to put up an incredible fight
            when hooked.
        -   Hawaii hosts one of the largest billfish tournaments in the
            United States. Most fish caught in recreational tournaments are
            tagged and released. Tournament proceeds, tackle, and
            trip-related expenditures contribute significantly to local
            economies.
        -   There is little bycatch associated with the recreational
            fishery.

    -   According to the [2010 stock
        assessment](http://www.iattc.org/StockAssessmentReportsENG.htm), the
        Eastern Pacific stock is not overfished and not subject to
        overfishing. The [Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission
        (IATTC)](https://www.iattc.org/HomeENG.htm) conducted this
        assessment.
    -   According to the [2015 stock
        assessment](http://isc.fra.go.jp/pdf/ISC15/Annex11_WCNPO_STM_ASSESSMENT_REPORT_2015.pdf),
        the Western and Central North Pacific stock is overfished and
        subject to overfishing. The overfished status of this stock of
        striped marlin is due to international fishing pressure. Because of
        this, the stock is not being managed under a rebuilding plan as
        would be required for purely domestic fish stocks.
    -   The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), of
        which the United States is a member, has agreed to international
        conservation and management measures for this species. While these
        current measures may not be sufficient in ending overfishing or
        rebuilding the stock, NOAA Fisheries continues to work with the
        Western Pacific and Pacific Fishery Management Councils and the U.S.
        Department of State to recommend or propose effective management
        measures to be adopted by the WCPFC.
    -   Population assessments for the Western and Central North Pacific
        striped marlin stock are conducted by the [Billfish Working
        Group](http://isc.fra.go.jp/working_groups/billfish.html) of the
        [International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-Like Species
        in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC)](http://isc.fra.go.jp/). NOAA
        Fisheries scientists participate in the ISC assessments and
        contribute relevant U.S. fishery data.

        -   Entry to this fishery is limited to a maximum of 164 vessels.
        -   Permits and logbooks are required.
        -   Observers are required on all Hawaii-based vessels using
            longlines.
        -   [NOAA Fisheries vessel monitoring system
            program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/enforcement/vessel-monitoring) requires
            longline boats to be equipped with a satellite transponder that
            provides real-time vessel position updates and tracks vessel
            movements.
        -   Longlines are prohibited in certain areas to protect endangered
            Hawaiian monk seals and reduce the potential for gear conflicts
            and localized stock depletion.
        -   Vessels operating under longline general permits must carry
            special gear to release incidentally hooked or entangled sea
            turtles, marine mammals, and seabirds, and fishermen must attend
            protected species workshops.
        -   Fishing gear requirements apply to all Hawaii longline limited
            access permitted vessels. The requirements may change depending
            on type of fishing trip, location of fishing, and how the gear
            is set. Regulation summaries can be found

        Fisheries for Highly Migratory
        Species](https://www.pcouncil.org/highly-migratory-species/fishery-management-plan-and-amendments/):
        -   Striped marlin is included in the plan because of its importance
            to the recreational (sport) fishery in California.
        -   There is no commercial fishery for striped marlin. Sale of
            striped marlin by vessels under PFMC jurisdiction is prohibited.
    -   Management of highly migratory species, like Pacific striped marlin,
        is complicated because the species migrates thousands of miles
        across international boundaries and are fished by many nations.
    -   Effective conservation and management of this resource requires
        international cooperation as well as strong domestic management.
    -   Two organizations, the [Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission
        (IATTC)](http://www.iattc.org/HomeENG.htm) and the [Western and
        Central Pacific Fisheries Commission
        (WCPFC)](https://www.wcpfc.int/) manage this fishery

    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   In response to the stock assessment in 2013, more restrictive
            regulations were implemented in the South Atlantic’s
            Snapper-Grouper FMP and commercial landings declined by half.
        -   In the Mid-Atlantic, NOAA implemented temporary management
            measures in 2015. In 2017, these were replaced by management
            measures developed by the Mid-Atlantic Council.
        -   In 2017, commercial landings of blueline tilefish totaled
            169,431 pounds and were valued at $408,753.
        -   2017 landings occurred in Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey,
            Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, and
            Louisiana. The highest landings were in North Carolina (46,431
            pounds), and Florida (89,631 pounds).
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Commercial fishermen mainly use longline and vertical
            hook-and-line gear to harvest blueline tilefish.
        -   Sea turtles, marine mammals, smalltooth sawfish, and reef fishes
            can be incidentally caught while fishing for blueline tilefish.
        -   Commercial reef fish fishermen in the South Atlantic and Gulf of
            Mexico must use “release gear” and follow safe-handling
            protocols to increase the chance of survival for incidentally
            caught protected species, like [sea turtles and smalltooth
            sawfish](http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/sustainable_fisheries/gulf_sa/turtle_sawfish_release/index.html).
        -   To further reduce bycatch, the use of trawl gear, fish traps,
            and bottom longlines are prohibited in certain areas of the
            South Atlantic, and several areas are also closed to all fishing
            to protect snapper and grouper species.
        -   To protect reef fish, sea turtles, and bottom habitat in the
            Gulf of Mexico, there are restrictions on the areas and depths
            where longlines can be used.
        -   In the Gulf of Mexico and certain areas of the South Atlantic,
            fishermen are required to use [circle
            hooks](https://teacheratsea.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/screen-shot-2013-04-18-at-7-15-32-am.jpg)
            to reduce injury to any unintentional catch.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Charterboat/headboat reef fish fishermen in the South Atlantic
            and Gulf of Mexico must use de-hooking devices and follow
            safe-handling protocols to increase the chance of survival for
            incidentally caught protected species, like [sea turtles and
            smalltooth
            sawfish](http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/sustainable_fisheries/gulf_sa/turtle_sawfish_release/index.html).
        -   In the Mid-Atlantic, for-hire vessels are required to have a
            permit and report catch, and recreational anglers can keep a
            limited number of blueline tilefish per fishing trip.
        -   In the South Atlantic, blueline tilefish are included in the
            daily aggregate grouper bag limit for recreational fishermen.
        -   In the Gulf of Mexico, there is a limit on the number of reef
            fish, including blueline tilefish, that recreational fishermen
            can keep per day.

    -   Blueline tilefish can grow to be 35 inches long and live up to 26
        years.
    -   Males can grow larger than females.
    -   Female blueline tilefish mature when they are about 3 years old.
    -   They can spawn year-round, but peak spawning is in May. Spawning
        primarily occurs at night.
    -   Females can lay more than 4 million free-floating eggs.
    -   Blueline tilefish feed primarily on invertebrates that live near the
        sea floor, such as crabs, shrimp, snails, worms, sea urchins, and
        small fish.
    -   Recent genetic studies suggest that the U.S. Atlantic population of
        blueline tilefish is continuous from the northeastern Gulf of
        Mexico, around the Florida Keys, and up through the Mid-Atlantic
        region.

    -   Red hake vary in color depending on their environment. Most tend to
        be a reddish brown to olive-brown color with pale tan spots on their
        sides and shades of white on their undersides.
    -   They are a member of the cod family and have a barbel (whisker) on
        their chin.
    -   Their dorsal fin is triangular, but their second dorsal and anal
        fins are long, continuous, and do not attach to the tail fin, much
        like an eel.
    -   They have a small head, but a large mouth with many small teeth.

  management:
  habitat: |
    -   The northern stock of red hake inhabits the waters of the Gulf of
        Maine and Northern Georges Bank, and the southern stock inhabits the
        waters of Southern Georges Bank and the Mid-Atlantic Bight.
    -   As nocturnal, semi-pelagic predators, red hake move up in the water
        column to feed at night, primarily between dusk and midnight. They
        return to rest on the ocean floor during the day, preferring sandy,
        muddy, or pebbly ocean bottoms.
    -   Red hake migrate in response to seasonal changes in water
        temperatures, moving toward shallow, warmer waters in the spring.
    -   They spawn in these shallow waters during late spring and early
        summer and then return to deeper waters in the autumn.
    -   Juveniles seek shelter from predators in scallop beds and commonly
        hide underneath [sea
        scallops](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/atlantic-sea-scallop).
    -   Older, larger red hake prefer deeper waters.
    -   During the summer, portions of both stocks can be found on Georges
        Bank.
    -   During the winter, fish in the northern stock move to deep basins in
        the Gulf of Maine, while fish in the southern stock move to outer
        continental shelf and slope waters.
    -   Red hake are widely distributed, and have been observed at
        temperature ranges of 2 to 17° C (36 to 63° F) and depth ranges of
        11 to 500 meters (36 to 1,640 feet). However, they are most commonly
        found in temperatures between 7 and 10° C (45 to 50° F).

  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   The 2016 landings of red hake totaled more than 1 million pounds
            and were valued at $453,300. The southern stock accounts for
            more than 67 percent of the landings and 74 percent of the total
            catch.
        -   Red hake is part of the small-mesh multispecies management unit,
            along with [silver
            hake](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/silver-hake) and
            offshore hake. This three-species complex is sometimes marketed
            together as whiting.
        -   Red hake are usually a bycatch species in the small-mesh
            fisheries that target whiting ([silver
            hake](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/silver-hake)) and
            squid.
        -   Low value and limited domestic market for red hake result in
            high percentages of discard which account for about 60% of the
            annual catch.
        -   Red hake are frequently used as bait in the lobster and tuna
            fisheries. Some are also sold as fillets.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Fishermen using small-mesh trawl gear to catch red hake must
            comply with a number of specific requirements to reduce bycatch
            of larger groundfish species.
        -   In designated areas, fishermen are required to use
            raised-footrope trawls, which are designed to keep the net off
            the bottom to reduce the bycatch of flatfish and other species.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Recreational fishermen do not target red hake but sometimes
            catch them incidentally while fishing for other groundfish.
        -   There are currently no restrictions on possession, size, or
            gear-type for red hake caught recreationally in federal waters.
        -   There are no specific areas for the recreational fishery.

  habitat: |
    -   Atlantic sharpnose sharks live in both warm-temperate and tropical
        waters, from the Bay of Fundy to the Yucatan.
    -   They can be found as deep as 920 feet, but mostly remain in waters
        less than 32 feet deep.
    -   They are commonly found in bays, estuaries, harbors, and the surf
        zone (area where waves break, commonly at 16 to 32 feet deep),
        mostly over mud and sand bottoms.
    -   Atlantic sharpnose sharks seasonally migrate between inshore and
        offshore waters, moving to deeper offshore waters in winter and
        returning to inshore waters in spring to mate and give birth.
    -   During migrations, they form large schools separated by sex.

    -   [NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science
        Center](https://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/) staff assesses the status of
        Atlantic sharpnose sharks through the [Southeast Data, Assessment,
        and Review](http://sedarweb.org) (SEDAR) process.
    -   Ongoing research priorities for Atlantic sharpnose sharks include
        enhancing life history information, identifying additional bycatch
        minimization strategies, and improving the identification of
        essential fish habitat. Scientists have made great strides
        collecting data on Atlantic sharpnose shark catch in other
        fisheries. For instance, records for sharks caught in shrimp trawls
        are now more detailed and include species-level information, which
        helps managers effectively understand and minimize bycatch of
        sharpnose sharks in the trawl fisheries.

  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   In 2017, commercial landings of Atlantic sharpnose shark in the
            Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico totaled 462,000 pounds, and were
            valued at $305,000. 
        -   To commercially harvest Atlantic sharks, vessel owners must
            obtain a valid Atlantic shark directed or incidental limited
            access permit or a smoothhound shark open access permit.  More
            information regarding limited access permits can be found in the
            [Atlantic HMS commercial compliance
            guide](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/atlantic-highly-migratory-species/atlantic-highly-migratory-species-fishery-compliance-guides#commercial-fishing-compliance-guide).
        -   Atlantic sharpnose shark belong to the small coastal shark (SCS)
            complex. For SCS sharks, there is no retention limit per vessel
            per trip for commercial fishermen with a directed permit.
        -   They are harvested primarily off the east coast of Florida and
            North Carolina.
        -   Their meat is sold as seafood and also used by fishermen as bait
            for other larger species of shark.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Commercial fishermen primarily use gillnet and bottom longline
            gear, which have minimal impacts on habitat due to how and where
            they are deployed.
        -   These gear types sometimes interact with sea turtles, marine
            mammals, and the endangered smalltooth sawfish.
        -   Several measures are in place to protect species that may be
            caught unintentionally in Atlantic sharpnose shark fisheries.
        -   Fishermen using bottom longline or gillnet gear must complete a
            protected species safe handling, release, and
            identification [workshop](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/atlantic-highly-migratory-species/atlantic-protected-species-safe-handling-release-and),
            and all bottom longline vessels must carry [sea turtle handling
            and release
            gear](http://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/sustainable_fisheries/gulf_sa/turtle_sawfish_release/index.html)
            on board.
        -   To reduce bycatch of finfish, including Atlantic sharpnose
            shark, shrimp trawlers are required to use [bycatch reduction
            devices](https://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/labs/mississippi/brd/),
            which are designed to retain shrimp but allow fish to exit the
            net.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   In 2017, approximately 110,000 Atlantic sharpnose sharks were
            caught recreationally in the United States.
        -   Recreational fishermen primarily use rod and reel gear, which
            have minimal impacts on habitat and bycatch.
        -   Recreational fishermen must have an Atlantic [HMS
            permit](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/atlantic-highly-migratory-species/atlantic-highly-migratory-species-permits-and-reporting-forms)
            to harvest Atlantic sharpnose sharks in federal waters. As of
            January 1, 2018, all HMS recreational permit holders will need a
            “shark endorsement” to fish for, retain, possess, or land
            sharks.
        -   Fishermen fishing recreationally for sharks will be required to
            use circle hook in most places.  For more information regarding
            these requirements, please refer to HMS regulations and the
            [Amendment 5b compliance
            guide](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/webdam/download/64522080).
        -   There is no minimum size for Atlantic sharpnose sharks.

    -   Atlantic sharpnose sharks can grow to up to 32 inches in length.
    -   They grow and mature at different rates in the Atlantic and Gulf of
        Mexico.
    -   Females mature at around 2 years old in the Atlantic when they reach
        approximately 24 inches in length, and at around 1.3 years old in
        the Gulf of Mexico when they are approximately 25 inches in length.
    -   Atlantic sharpnose sharks have been observed to live up to 18 years.
    -   In both the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic sharpnose sharks
        mate annually between mid-May and mid-July in inshore waters.
    -   After mating they migrate offshore to deeper waters.
    -   The mother feeds the pups through a placental sac and after a
        gestation period of 10 to 11 months the females return to nearshore
        areas to give birth in June.
    -   Litters average approximately four pups in both the Gulf of Mexico
        and Atlantic.
    -   Atlantic sharpnose sharks eat small fish, including menhaden, eels,
        silversides, wrasses, jacks, toadfish, and filefish. They also eat
        worms, shrimp, crabs, and mollusks.
    -   Large carnivorous fish, including large sharks, eat Atlantic
        sharpnose sharks.

    -   Pacific sardines live in the water column in nearshore and offshore
        areas along the coast.
    -   They are sometimes found in estuaries.
    -   They form large, dense schools near the ocean surface.
    -   Pacific sardines move seasonally along the coast.
        -   Older adults may move from spawning grounds in southern
            California and northern Baja California to feeding/spawning
            grounds off the Pacific Northwest and Canada.
        -   Younger adults appear to migrate to feeding grounds primarily in

  taste: |
    When fresh, small sardines have a delicate flavor. Larger sardines have
    a fuller, oilier flavor, similar to anchovies but milder. If buying
    fresh, look for sardines with bright eyes, shiny skin, and a mildly
    fishy aroma. Plan to cook them within a day of purchase.
  health_benefits: |
    Sardines are a very good source of selenium and vitamin B12 and a good
    source of calcium, niacin, phosphorus, and omega-3 fatty acids.
  harvest: |
    -   The fishery was closed in 2015, and has not reopened.
    -   In 2014, more than 23,000 metric tons were harvested and were valued
        at $8.85 million.
    -   Round haul nets are used to catch Pacific sardines.
    -   Habitat and bycatch impacts are minimal because the gear is used at
        the surface around dense schools of fish, which usually contain only
        one species.

    Butterfish is a good source of niacin, vitamin B6, phosphorus, protein,
    vitamin B12, and selenium.
  harvest: |
    -   In 2016, commercial landings of butterfish totaled more than 2.5
        million pounds and were valued at more than $1.7 million.
    -   Butterfish are primarily landed in Point Judith and North Kingstown,
        Rhode Island; Montauk, New York; and New Bedford, Massachusetts.
        They are generally exported to Japan, where they are a popular menu
        item.
    -   Otter trawls are used to catch butterfish.
    -   Otter trawls can incidentally catch other fish and marine mammals as
        bycatch, and can impact habitat, depending on where they are used.
    -   Gear restrictions (minimum mesh size) when fishing with otter trawls
        are used to reduce bycatch.

    -   According to the [2018 stock
        assessment](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/17246),
        butterfish are not overfished and not subject to overfishing.
    -   The assessment indicated that butterfish are estimated to be at 141
        percent of the target population level. However, scientists are
        concerned that recruitment (the number of smaller fish entering the
        fishery) has been declining in recent years.
    -   Scientists at [NOAA’s Northeast Fisheries Science
        Center](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/) survey the abundance of
        butterfish off the East Coast.
    -   They added temperature and habitat information into the stock
        assessment model, which helps them more accurately estimate fish
        abundance. Using this approach, the model indicated that the
        population was more abundant than previously estimated.
    -   Incorporating this type of environmental information into stock
        assessments will become increasingly important as the climate
        changes and the oceans warm.

    -   Winter skate live on sand and gravel bottoms in the northwest
        Atlantic, most commonly in southern New England and on Georges Bank.
        They are occasionally found in the Gulf of Maine, on the Scotian
        Shelf, in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and in the Mid-Atlantic.
    -   Skates are not known to migrate far, but they do move with the
        seasons as water temperature changes. They are generally offshore
        during the summer and early autumn and inshore during winter and
        spring.

  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   In 2015, commercial landings totaled 10,900 metric tons, and
            were valued at $5.3 million.
        -   More than half of skate landings come from Massachusetts and
            Rhode Island.
        -   Skates are harvested in two different fisheries, one for wings
            for human consumption and one for lobster bait.
            -   In the bait fishery, vessels from southern New England
                target mostly little skates (more than 90 percent) and, to a
                much lesser extent, juvenile winter skates (less than 10
                percent). Juvenile winter skates are difficult to
                differentiate from little skates because they look nearly
                identical.
            -   The wing fishery is labor-intensive because the wings need
                to be cut into fillets, but participation has grown recently
                due to increasing restrictions on other, more profitable
                groundfish species.
            -   In the wing fishery, mainly trawlers and gillnetters harvest
                winter skates when targeting other species such as
                groundfish, monkfish, and scallops. Fishermen keep the
                skates if the price is profitable.

    &nbsp;

    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Most skates are caught incidentally in otter trawl fisheries
            targeting other more valuable species, such as groundfish,
            monkfish, and scallops. Otter trawls can impact habitat
            depending on where they are used. They can also interact with
            marine mammals (e.g., whales, harbor porpoises, and seals) and
            sea turtles. Management measures including closed areas,
            restrictions on gear and fishing effort, and modifying fishing
            gear to reduce contact with habitat help reduce these impacts
            and interactions.
        -   Skates are also caught in bottom gillnet fisheries, which have
            less of an impact on habitat.
        -   Skates are caught and discarded as bycatch in numerous
            fisheries, but the rate of discards has decreased in recent
            years as the value of skate products has increased.

        winter skate are not overfished and are not subject to overfishing.
        Scientists use a simple index method to detect significant changes
        in the annual fisheries survey. Winter skates are not subject to
        overfishing based on this method.
    -   Seven skate species, including winter skate, are assessed and
        managed as one northeast skate complex. There is a lack of data for
        this complex. New requirements to report skate landings by species
        should improve the data-poor nature of this complex.
    -   Estimates of winter skate abundance, or biomass, peaked in the
        mid-1980s, declined through the early 1990s, and increased again in

    -   Winter skates have large bodies and can grow up to 5 feet in length.
    -   They can live for about 20 years.
    -   They reproduce at a late age, when they’re approximately 11 years
        old and 2.5 feet long.
    -   Skates lay eggs year-round but have few offspring. Their eggs are
        enclosed in a hard leathery case called a “mermaid’s purse.” The
        eggs incubate for 6 to 12 months, and young skates have the adult
        form when they hatch.
    -   Skates feed on a variety of organisms such as crustaceans, mollusks,
        worms, squids, and fish.

    -   Pink salmon are the smallest of the Pacific salmon found in North
        America, weighing between 3.5 and 5 pounds, with an average length
        of 20 to 25 inches.
    -   Pink salmon can be distinguished from other Pacific salmon by the
        large dark oval spots on their back and entire tail fin as well as
        their general coloring and form.
    -   In the sea, pink salmon are steel blue to blue-green on the back,
        silver on the sides, and white on the belly.
    -   Breeding males become dark on the back and red with brownish green
        blotches on the sides.
    -   Males also develop a hump on their back, which is why they are often
        called “humpback” salmon.
    -   Breeding females are similar but lack a dorsal hump and are less
        distinctly colored.

    Pink salmon is low in sodium and is a good source of omega-3 fatty
    acids, protein, niacin, vitamin B12, and selenium.
  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   In 2016, commercial harvest of pink salmon totaled more than
            130 million pounds, valued at approximately $30 million.
        -   Almost all the pink salmon harvested in the United States comes
            from Alaska fisheries.
        -   Small numbers of pink salmon are also harvested off the West
            Coast, mainly Washington, especially in odd-numbered years (see
            the Science section for more about pink salmon’s unique two-year
            life cycle).
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Purse seines, gillnets, and reef nets are used to catch pink
            salmon.
        -   Purse seiners catch salmon by encircling them with a long net
            and drawing the bottom closed to capture the fish.
        -   Gillnetters catch salmon by setting curtain-like nets
            perpendicular to the pink salmon trajectory as they migrate
            along the coast toward fresh water.
        -   Fishing gear used to catch pink salmon rarely contacts the ocean
            floor and has little impact on habitat.
        -   Bycatch is low and usually consists of other salmon species.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Salmon are a favorite catch of recreational fishermen.
        -   Recreational fishermen use a variety of fishing gear to harvest
            pink salmon.
        -   While their relatively small size makes them less popular with
            sport anglers than other salmon species, pink salmon are
            excellent fish to catch because they’re aggressive and make a
            nice, mild-tasting meal.
        -   To ensure recreational fisheries are sustainable, West Coast
            anglers are only allowed to keep a certain number of salmon per
            fishing trip.
        -   In Alaska, regulations vary by area and individual fisheries.
        -   Recreational fisheries in high-use areas (Cook Inlet, Southeast
            Alaska, Copper River) are regulated through management plans
            that allocate fish between competing commercial and recreational
            fishermen.
    -   Subsistence fishery:
        -   Salmon is an important source of spiritual and physical
            sustenance for Western Indian tribes and Alaska natives, and
            salmon are culturally important to many other residents of these
            areas.
        -   Subsistence fishermen use a variety of fishing gear to harvest
            pink salmon.

        manage pink salmon on the West Coast.
    -   Managed under the [Pacific Coast Salmon
        Plan](https://www.pcouncil.org/salmon/fishery-management-plan/adoptedapproved-amendments/):
        -   Every year, the council reviews reports of the previous fishing
            season and current estimates of salmon abundance. Using this
            information, they make recommendations for management of the
            upcoming fishing season.
        -   Their general goal is to allow fishermen to harvest the maximum
            amount of salmon that will support the fishery while preventing
            overharvest of the resource and ensuring that salmon populations
            with low abundance can rebuild.
        -   Specific management measures vary year to year depending on
            current salmon abundance, and include size limits, season
            length, quotas, and gear restrictions.
        -   The council usually increases harvest limits for pink salmon in
            odd years when more adults are returning to spawn.
        -   Management of pink salmon must also comply with laws such as the
            [Endangered Species
            Act](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/laws-policies#endangered-species-act).
        -   Final recommendations are implemented by NOAA Fisheries. [Check
            here](https://www.pcouncil.org/salmon/current-season-management/)
            for the current season’s management. State and tribal managers
            use council management recommendations to shape their policies
            for inland fisheries, to ensure that conservation objectives are
            met.
    -   [NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/region/alaska) and
        the [North Pacific Fishery Management
        Council](https://www.npfmc.org/) manage pink salmon in Alaska.
    -   Managed under the [Fishery Management Plan for Salmon Fisheries in
        the EEZ off the Coast of
        Alaska](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/management-plan/alaska-salmon-fisheries-management-plan):
        -   All management of the salmon fisheries in federal waters is
            delegated to the [State of
            Alaska](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=CommercialByFisherySalmon.main),
            which is also responsible for managing the commercial,
            recreational, and subsistence fisheries for salmon in state
            waters. This ensures that management is consistent throughout
            salmon’s range.
            -   Managers regulate the fishery based on [escapement
                goals](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=sonar.escapementgoals) to
                ensure harvests are sustainable. They want enough salmon to
                be able to escape the fishery and return to fresh water to
                spawn and replenish the population.
            -   Salmon fishery management largely relies on in-season
                assessment of how many salmon return to fresh water to
                spawn.
            -   Managers set harvest levels based on these returns. When
                abundance is high and the number of fish returning is much
                higher than that needed to meet escapement goals, harvest
                levels are set higher.
            -   In years of low abundance, harvest levels are lowered.
        -   During the fishing season, scientists monitor catch and
            escapement, comparing current returns with those from previous
            years, to keep an eye on abundance and actively manage the
            fishery.
    -   Off the West Coast and in Alaska, the [Pacific Salmon
        Treaty](https://www.psc.org/about_treaty.htm) and the [Pacific
        Salmon Commission](https://www.psc.org/index.htm) help coordinate
        management, research, and enhancement of shared U.S. and
        international salmon stocks, including pink salmon.

    -   Pink salmon are anadromous – they hatch in freshwater streams and
        rivers then migrate out to the saltwater environment of the ocean to
        feed and grow.
    -   Unlike [coho](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/coho-salmon),
        [Chinook](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/chinook-salmon), or
        [sockeye](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/sockeye-salmon) salmon,
        pink salmon do not reside in fresh water for an extended period.
    -   Young pink salmon (fry) typically migrate directly to estuarine and
        marine waters soon after they are born.
    -   Once they reach the ocean, they feed voraciously and grow rapidly.
        In fact, they’re among the fastest growing of the Pacific salmon
        species.
    -   After about 1½ years of feeding and growing in the ocean, maturing
        pink salmon return to fresh water to spawn, usually from August to
        October.
    -   Females construct nests (redds) in the riverbed by turning on their
        sides and vigorously flexing their bodies and tails, digging a
        shallow hole.
    -   Females deposit between 1,200 and 1,900 eggs in the redds, which the
        males then fertilize.
    -   The female stays and defends her redd from other females until she
        dies, usually within two weeks.
    -   All pink salmon die after they spawn.
    -   They typically spawn at the age of 2.
    -   Because the pink salmon life cycle is so regular, independent
        populations spawn in even and odd years. For example, in the
        southern part of their range, they usually spawn in odd years in
        most river systems. However, pink salmon do spawn in even years in
        some Puget Sound rivers.
    -   Throughout most of Alaska, there is no dominant year, except in the
        northwestern part of Alaska where even-year runs predominate.
    -   Pink salmon feed on small crustaceans, zooplankton (tiny floating
        animals), squid, and small fish.
    -   In fresh water, aquatic invertebrates, other fishes, birds, and
        small mammals prey on pink salmon eggs, alevins, and fry.
    -   In the ocean, other fishes (including other Pacific salmon) and
        coastal seabirds prey on pink salmon fry and juveniles.
    -   Marine mammals, sharks, other fishes (such as [Pacific
        halibut](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/pacific-halibut)), and
        humpback whales feed on adult pink salmon.
    -   In freshwater spawning habitats, bears are predators of adult pink
        salmon. Wolves, river otters, and bald eagles will also occasionally
        eat pre-spawning adult pinks.
    -   After salmon spawn and die, [salmon
        carcasses](http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&articles_id=97&issue_id=21)
        are a valuable source of energy and nutrients to the river
        ecosystem. Carcasses have been shown to improve newly hatched salmon
        growth and survival by contributing nitrogen and phosphorous
        compounds to streams.

    -   Northern shrimp are crustaceans, like lobsters and crabs.
    -   They are much smaller than warm-water shrimp, averaging 2 to 4
        inches in length.
    -   When alive, the tails and bodies of northern shrimp are more red
        than pink, and the shells are translucent.
    -   They have appendages called
        [pleopods](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/femad/pbb/fwdp/training/img35.jpg)
        on their tail that act like paddles and enable them to move with

  habitat: |
    -   Northern shrimp are found in the cold waters of the North Atlantic,
        North Pacific, and Arctic Oceans. On the U.S. Atlantic coast,
        northern shrimp are mainly found in waters off of Maine, New
        Hampshire, and Massachusetts.
    -   They live on soft mud bottoms in waters approximately 30 to 1,000
        feet deep.
    -   Northern shrimp appear to travel with seasonal changes in water
        temperature. They’re only common in nearshore waters during late
        winter and spring when these waters are coldest.
    -   Egg-bearing females move inshore in late fall and winter when
        nearshore waters have cooled. After their eggs hatch (February to
        April), females return to offshore waters in the western Gulf of
        Maine.
    -   Larvae and young juveniles remain in nearshore waters for up to 20
        months as they develop. After 1 year, juveniles begin to migrate
        offshore to deeper waters.

  health_benefits: |
    Northern shrimp are low in saturated fat and high in iron, phosphorus,

  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   The fishery has been closed by moratorium since 2014 because the
            stock has collapsed. Due to continued low population levels the
            moratorium has been extended each year.
        -   Following high landings in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the
            fishery was closed in 1978 due to a stock collapse. It was
            reopened the following year, and landings increased throughout
            the 1980s and 1990s before dropping again. For several seasons
            prior to the 2014 fishing moratorium, the commercial season was
            closed early due to landings exceeding the catch limit.
        -   The fishery is seasonal in nature, peaking in late winter when
            egg-bearing females move into inshore waters where the eggs
            hatch.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Fishermen mainly use otter trawls to harvest northern shrimp,
            although some Maine fishermen use traps.
        -   Northern shrimp are harvested over soft mud bottoms, which are
            more resilient to the impacts of trawling compared to structured
            habitats such as corals. Also, the small mesh in the shrimp
            otter trawls creates more drag than a groundfish net and can’t
            be towed as fast for the same size net, reducing the potential
            impact on shrimp habitat.
        -   Minimum mesh size in trawls to prevent bycatch of small male
            shrimp.
        -   Finfish excluder devices and size-sorting grates in the gear to
            prevent bycatch of groundfish and small male shrimp.

    -   According to the [2018 stock
        assessment](http://www.asmfc.org/uploads/file/5c000eb2NShrimpAssessmentUpdateReport_2018.pdf)
        conducted by the [Atlantic States Marine Fisheries
        Commission](http://www.asmfc.org/species/northern-shrimp), the
        northern shrimp stock has collapsed and stock size has remained at
        unprecedented lows for several years. Since there has been a fishing
        moratorium in place since 2014, there is no directed fishing, and
        the stock is not subject to overfishing.
    -   Abundance of northern shrimp is primarily monitored by the joint
        State-Federal summer [shrimp
        survey](http://www.asmfc.org/fisheries-science/surveys). The
        Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission’s Northern Shrimp
        Technical Committee provides annual stock assessments and related
        information to fishery managers.
    -   Recruitment of northern shrimp is dependent on several factors
        including ocean temperatures and spawning biomass. Ocean
        temperatures in the western Gulf of Maine have increased in recent
        years and are predicted to continue rising. This suggests an
        increasingly inhospitable environment for northern shrimp and the
        need for strong conservation efforts to help sustain the stock.
    -   An increase in northern shrimp predators ([spiny
        dogfish](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/atlantic-spiny-dogfish),
        [redfish](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/acadian-redfish), and
        [silver hake](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/silver-hake)) may
        also be contributing to a decline in the stock.

  fishery_management: |
    -   The states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts cooperatively
        manage the northern shrimp resource under the framework of the
        [Atlantic States Marine Fisheries
        Commission's](http://www.asmfc.org/) [Interstate Fishery Management
        Plan for Northern
        Shrimp](http://www.asmfc.org/species/northern-shrimp).
        -   Fishery closed since 2014 due to depleted stock conditions.
        -   Annual catch limits with seasonal closures when a percentage of
            the catch limit is projected to be caught.
        -   Limits on the amount of northern shrimp that can be harvested
            per fishing trip.
        -   Limits on the number of traps fishermen can set during a season.
        -   Days out of the fishery – certain days during the fishing season
            are closed to fishing to slow catch rates and prolong the
            fishing season, or to make shrimp available when demand is
            greatest.
        -   Minimum mesh size in trawl nets to prevent bycatch of undersized
            shrimp.
        -   Requirement to use [finfish excluder
            devices](http://images.slideplayer.com/24/6987356/slides/slide_20.jpg)
            to reduce bycatch in the fishery.
        -   Due to the variability in population size from year to year,
            managers annually adjust management measures (e.g., fishing
            season length, harvest limits, etc.), based on the results of
            annual stock assessments and stakeholder input.
        -   Amendment 3 to the Interstate Fisheries Management Plan for
            Northern Shrimp outlines measures to improve management in the
            event that the fishery re-opens. These measures include:
            -   State-specific allocations of the total allowable catch.
            -   Required use of a double-[Nordmore
                grate](http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/peches-fisheries/ifmp-gmp/shrimp-crevette/images/shrimp-crevette-2003-fig2b-eng.jpg)
                or compound grate system to minimize catch of small male
                shrimp.
            -   Strengthened reporting requirements for catch and landings.

    -   Northern shrimp are protandrous hermaphrodites – they begin life as
        males and sexually mature at roughly 2½ years old. They transform to
        females at about 3½ years old.
    -   They start spawning in late July in offshore waters, mainly in deep
        mud basins in the southwestern Gulf of Maine. By early fall, most
        adult females have pushed their eggs out onto their abdomen.
    -   In late fall through winter, egg-bearing females move inshore where
        the eggs hatch. Juveniles remain in coastal waters for a year or
        more before migrating to deeper offshore waters, where they mature
        as males.
    -   Their reproductive success, growth, and development can be affected
        by temperature. They can grow up to 3 or 4 inches long, and most do
        not live past age 5.
    -   They prey on plankton (tiny floating plants and animals) and
        bottom-dwelling invertebrates.
    -   They are eaten by many important fish species such as cod, redfish,
        and silver and white hake.
    -   Northern shrimp are an important part of the marine food chain, and
        maintaining a healthy population is important to supporting a
        balanced Gulf of Maine ecosystem.

    -   Swordfish live in surface water to mid-water but feed throughout the
        water column.
    -   Scientists know little about the migration of Pacific swordfish, but
        tagging data suggest swordfish move eastward from the central
        Pacific, north of Hawaii, toward the U.S. West Coast.

  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   In 2017, commercial landings of swordfish in Hawaii totaled more
            than 3.5 million pounds and were valued at approximately
            $6 million.
        -   In 2017, commercial landings of swordfish in California totaled
            more than 1.5 million pounds and were valued at more than
            $3.8 million.
        -   The majority of North Pacific swordfish landed in California is
            landed by Hawaii-based vessels.
        -   Hawaii-based longliners accounted for approximately 85 percent
            of U.S. catch of North Pacific swordfish and 16 percent of all
            North Pacific-wide swordfish catch in 2017.
        -   Total U.S. catch in 2017 was more than 4.1 million pounds,
            approximately 19 percent of the North Pacific–wide swordfish
            catch.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Commercial fishermen use longline gear to harvest swordfish in
            federal waters off of Hawaii and on the high seas.
        -   On the West Coast, commercial fishermen harvest swordfish using
            drift gillnets and harpoons.
        -   Fishing gear used to catch swordfish rarely contacts the
            seafloor so habitat impacts are minimal.
        -   Longlines and gillnets can incidentally catch sea turtles,
            marine mammals, seabirds, sharks, and other finfish species.
            Gear restrictions and operational requirements are in place to
            minimize bycatch.
        -   U.S. longline and drift gillnet vessels operate under
            regulations to minimize impacts on other species.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Off the U.S. West Coast, recreational fishermen fish for
            swordfish with rod-and-reel gear. They are prohibited from
            selling their catch.
        -   Fishermen must have a fishing license to catch and land
            swordfish and are allowed to keep two swordfish per day.
        -   Commercial passenger fishing vessels must have a permit and keep
            a monthly log of their fishing activity.
        -   There are no federal regulations for recreational fishing off
            Hawaii and U.S. Pacific Island territories, but local rules may
            apply.

    -   [NOAA Fisheries](http://www.westcoast.fisheries.noaa.gov/) and the
        [Pacific Fishery Management Council](https://www.pcouncil.org/)
        manage the North Pacific swordfish fishery on the West Coast.
    -   Managed under the [Fishery Management Plan for U.S. West Coast
        Fisheries for Highly Migratory
        Species](https://www.pcouncil.org/highly-migratory-species/fishery-management-plan-and-amendments/):
        -   Fishermen are required to have permits and to record catch in
            logbooks.
        -   Gear restrictions and operational requirements are in place to
            minimize bycatch.
        -   Longline and drift gillnet fishing boats are required to carry
            observers when requested.
        -   Longline fishing is prohibited within 200 miles of the U.S. West
            Coast.
        -   Longline fishing regulations vary by gear type (shallow-set,
            deep-set, etc.) and fishing area (eastern Pacific, high seas,
            etc.).
        -   Drift gillnets are allowed in federal waters but not in state
            waters.
        -   Time and areas closures are in place to protect leatherback and
            loggerhead sea turtles.
        -   Training in safe handling and release techniques for protected
            species is required and all longline vessels must carry and use
            specific equipment for handling and releasing these animals.
    -   [NOAA
        Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/region/pacific-islands)
        and [Western Pacific Fishery Management
        Council](http://wpcouncil.org/) manage the North Pacific swordfish
        fishery in the Pacific Islands.
    -   Managed under the [Fishery Ecosystem Plan for the Pelagic Fisheries
        of the Western
        Pacific](http://www.wpcouncil.org/fishery-plans-policies-reports/pelagics_fe/):
        -   Fishermen are required to have permits and to record catch in
            logbooks.
        -   A limit on the number of permits for Hawaii and American Samoa
            longline fisheries controls participation in the fishery.
        -   Gear restrictions and operational requirements to minimize
            bycatch:
            -   Circle hooks and finfish bait reduce the number of sea
                turtles caught and cause less injury to sea turtles that are
                hooked.
            -   Sea turtle handling and release protocols that minimize
                further injury and increase the chance of survival.
            -   Annual limits on the number of leatherback and loggerhead
                sea turtles that can be caught in the Hawaii longline
                fishery. If either limit is reached, the fishery is closed
                for the rest of the year.
            -   Gear restrictions to minimize seabird interactions and
                injury to seabirds.
        -   Longline fishing is prohibited in some areas to protect
            endangered Hawaiian monk seals and to reduce conflicts between
            fishermen.
        -   These areas are enforced through the NOAA Fisheries [vessel
            monitoring system
            program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/enforcement/vessel-monitoring)
            (longline boats must be equipped with a satellite transponder
            that provides real-time position updates and tracks vessel
            movements).
        -   Hawaii-based longline vessels must carry onboard observers when
            requested by NOAA Fisheries, in part to record interactions with
            sea turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals.
        -   Annual training in safe handling and release techniques for
            protected species is required, and all vessels must carry and
            use specific equipment for handling and releasing these animals.
    -   Management of highly migratory species, like Pacific swordfish, is
        complicated because the species migrate thousands of miles across
        international boundaries and are fished by many nations.
    -   Effective conservation and management of this resource requires
        international cooperation as well as strong domestic management.
    -   Two organizations, the [Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission
        (IATTC)](http://www.iattc.org/HomeENG.htm) and the [Western and
        Central Pacific Fisheries Commission
        (WCPFC)](https://www.wcpfc.int/), manage this fishery
        internationally. Historically, the [International Scientific
        Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean
        (ISC)](http://isc.fra.go.jp/) conducted stock assessments to
        determine the status of both the Western and Central North Pacific
        Ocean stock and the Eastern Pacific Ocean stock
        of swordfish. However, the IATTC is expected to conduct the next
        assessment of the Eastern Pacific Ocean stock. Working with the U.S.
        Department of State, NOAA Fisheries domestically implements the
        IATTC and WCPFC conservation and management measures.

  biology: |
    -   Swordfish are one of the fastest and largest predators in the ocean.
        Their streamlined body allows them to swim at high speeds, up to 50
        mph.
    -   They grow rapidly, reaching a maximum length of 14 feet and almost
        1,200 pounds (although the average size caught in the fishery is
        50–200 pounds).
    -   They are able to reproduce when they reach 5 to 6 years old.
    -   Swordfish spawn numerous times throughout the year near the surface
        of warm tropical and sub-tropical waters.
    -   In cooler waters, they spawn several times during the spring and
        summer.
    -   Swordfish are productive, and their eggs are fertilized externally
        and float at the sea surface where they incubate for about 2 1/2
        days. Swordfish live for about 9 years.
    -   Swordfish feed on a variety of fish and invertebrates such as squid.
    -   They capture their prey by slashing their bills back and forth,
        stunning or injuring the prey in the process.
    -   They have developed unique characteristics, such as special eye
        muscles and a heat exchange system that allow them to swim in deep
        cold water in search of prey.
    -   Swordfish feed at the top of the food chain and are rarely preyed
        upon by other animals, but juvenile swordfish are sometimes eaten by
        sharks and larger predatory fish.

  physical_description: |
    -   Atlantic mackerel are iridescent blue green on the back with a
        silvery white underbelly.
    -   They have 20 to 30 wavy black bars that run across the top half of
        their body, and a narrow dark streak that runs below these bars
        along each side.
    -   Their body is spindle-shaped, tapering at both ends.
    -   Their two large dorsal fins are gray or dusky. The pectoral fins are
        black or dusky at the base, and the tail fin is gray or dusky.
    -   Their distinctive coloring fades quickly after they die.

    and exported to markets around the world.
  research: |
    -   Scientists at NOAA’s [Northeast Fisheries Science
        Center](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/) collect information on Atlantic
        mackerel through their bottom trawl surveys. They research the
        abundance, biology, and distribution of Atlantic mackerel and other
        marine resources in the Northwest Atlantic. They use this
        information to assess the status of the Atlantic mackerel stock and
        provide recommendations to managers.
    -   Atlantic mackerel are sensitive to changes in water temperature and
        migrate long distances on a seasonal basis to feed and spawn. NOAA
        Fisheries scientists have found that changing environmental factors
        have altered the distribution of Atlantic mackerel, shifting the
        stock northeastward and into shallower waters. These
        [findings](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/press_release/2011/SciSpot/SS1104/)
        could have significant implications for U.S. commercial and
        recreational mackerel fisheries, which mostly occur during late
        winter and early spring.

  health_benefits: |
    Mackerel is high in omega-3 fatty acids and is an excellent source of
    selenium, niacin, and vitamins B6 and B12.
  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   In 2016, commercial landings of Atlantic mackerel totaled 11.7
            million pounds and were valued at more than $3 million.
            Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Jersey harvested the
            majority.
        -   Commercial landings from 2004 to 2016 ranged from a high of 125
            million pounds in 2006 to a low of 1.1 million pounds in 2011.
        -   The U.S. commercial fishery for Atlantic mackerel operates
            primarily between January and May in southern New England and
            Mid-Atlantic coastal waters and between May and December in the
            Gulf of Maine.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Fishermen harvest mackerel in large volumes using mid-water
            trawls.
        -   Although mid-water trawls have minimal impact on habitat, they
            can incidentally catch marine mammals such as short- and
            long-finned pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, and
            common dolphins.
        -   The [Atlantic Trawl Gear Take Reduction
            Strategy](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/prot_res/atgtrp/meeting/ATGTRT%20Draft%20Take%20Reduction%20Strategy%20FINAL.pdf)
            provides measures to reduce potential impacts of bycatch. These
            include outreach to educate fishermen about actions to take in
            the event of a marine mammal interaction and efforts to
            communicate interaction hotspots to fishermen in real time. It
            also contains voluntary measures concerning fishing practices,
            such as reducing tow times and limiting turns while fishing.
        -   The mackerel fishery has some incidental catch of river herring
            and shad. A cap was established in 2014 to limit river herring
            and shad catch in the mackerel fishery.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Mackerel are important to recreational fisheries in the
            Mid-Atlantic and New England regions, with the highest landings
            occurring from Massachusetts to Maine.
        -   In 2016, recreational harvest of Atlantic mackerel totaled 3
            million pounds, most of which was caught in Massachusetts, New
            Hampshire, and Maine. 
        -   The recreational mackerel fishery is open all year, with a catch
            limit set annually at the same time as commercial limits.

        -   Managers monitor commercial catch on a weekly basis and will
            close the fisheries if the limits are reached before the fishing
            season is over.
        -   Fishermen must have a permit to harvest Atlantic mackerel.
        -   Managers limit the amount of available permits to control

    -   They can live up to 20 years and are able to reproduce by the time
        they reach age 2 to 3.
    -   There are two major spawning groups of Atlantic mackerel in the
        western Atlantic:
        -   The southern group spawns primarily in the Mid-Atlantic Bight
            from April to May.
        -   The northern group spawns in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in June
            and July.
        -   Both groups typically spawn 10 to 30 miles off shore.
    -   Depending on their size, females can have between 285,000 and almost
        2 million eggs. They release their eggs in batches, between five and
        seven times throughout the spawning season.
    -   Eggs generally float in the surface water and hatch in 4 to 7 ½
        days, depending on water temperature.
    -   Atlantic mackerel feed heavily on crustaceans such as copepods,
        krill, and shrimp. They also eat squid, as well as some fish and
        ascidians (sac-like marine invertebrate filter feeders).
    -   Several species of fish and marine mammals eat Atlantic mackerel.

    -   Bigeye tuna are dark metallic blue on the back and upper sides and
        white on the lower sides and belly.
    -   The first fin on their back is deep yellow, the second dorsal and
        anal fins are pale yellow, and the finlets are bright yellow with
        black edges.
    -   Bigeye and
        [yellowfin](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/atlantic-yellowfin-tuna)
        tuna look fairly similar. In fact, it’s hard to distinguish the two
        species without experience.
    -   Among other characteristics, the bigeye’s eyes are larger than the
        yellowfin’s and their finlets have black edges.

  habitat: |
    -   Bigeye tuna are a highly migratory species, swimming long distances
        throughout the ocean.
    -   They often swim in schools and live at or near the surface but dive
        into deeper waters (to about 800 feet, deeper than other tropical
        tunas) during the day.
    -   Larvae are found in tropical waters, and as juvenile fish grow
        larger they tend to move into temperate waters.
    -   As juveniles they often school with
        [yellowfin](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/atlantic-yellowfin-tuna)
        and
        [skipjack](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/atlantic-skipjack-tuna)
        tunas at the surface, especially in warm waters.

  research: |
    -   Skipjack often school around floating objects, including [fish
        aggregating
        devices](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/bycatch/fishing-gear-fish-aggregating-devices)
        (FADs) intentionally placed in the water to attract fish. Foreign
        purse seiners and baitboats have used FADs extensively in the
        Atlantic since the early 1990s to catch skipjack, primarily off the
        coast of West Africa. Researchers have found that the increasing use
        of FADs has changed the species composition of tuna catches,
        resulting in a higher capture rate of juvenile
        [yellowfin](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/atlantic-yellowfin-tuna)
        and bigeye tuna for vessels targeting
        [skipjack](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/atlantic-skipjack-tuna).
        The higher capture rate of juvenile bigeye tuna in purse seine
        fisheries associated with FADs has been demonstrated by ICCAT to
        reduce the overall maximum sustainable yield of the stock. The
        increased presence of FADs may also have an impact on the biology
        and ecology of skipjack, bigeye, and yellowfin tuna. Also, sea
        turtles and marine mammals can become entangled in nets, ropes, and
        lines that are used in the FADs. This research influenced ICAAT’s
        requirements related to the use of FADs in the bigeye tuna fishery
        (see management section).

  health_benefits: |
    Bigeye tuna is low in saturated fat and sodium and is rich in niacin,
    vitamins B6 and B12, selenium, and phosphorous.
  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   U.S. harvest of Atlantic bigeye tuna is usually only a small
            fraction (1 percent or less) of the global Atlantic bigeye
            harvest.
        -   In 2017, U.S. commercial landings of Atlantic bigeye tuna
            totaled 788 metric tons dressed weight, and were valued at more
            than $5.4 million..
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   U.S. commercial fishermen mainly harvest bigeye tuna using
            pelagic longlines. They sometimes use rod-and-reel gear.
        -   Fishing gear used to catch bigeye tuna rarely contacts the
            seafloor so habitat impacts are minimal.
        -   Commercial fishing gear can catch protected species such as
            marine mammals and sea turtles.
        -   NOAA Fisheries has taken the following additional measures to
            reduce bycatch, bycatch mortality, and sustainably manage the
            pelagic longline fishery. Fishermen are:
            -   Required to use large circle hooks and certain types of bait
                that limit gear interactions with sea turtles. Circle hooks
                are specifically designed to minimize the damage caused by
                hooking, giving animals that are captured and released a
                better chance at survival.
            -   Trained to use special techniques to safely dehook and
                release any incidentally caught turtles.
            -   Required to stop fishing and move 1 nautical mile if they
                encounter a protected species.
            -   Required to protect pilot whales and Risso's dolphins when
                fishing in the Mid-Atlantic Bight by limiting the length of
                their lines to 20 nautical miles and posting [marine mammal
                handling/release
                guidelines](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/atlantic-highly-migratory-species/safe-handling-release-and-identification-workshops)
                on their vessels. In addition, if fishing in the Cape
                Hatteras Special Research Area, pelagic longliners must
                contact NOAA Fisheries at least 48 hours prior to a trip and
                carry observers if requested.
            -   Required to use weak hooks in the Gulf of Mexico to reduce
                incidental catch of bluefin tuna and prohibited from using
                live bait to reduce bycatch of billfish.
            -   Restricted from certain areas of the Gulf of Mexico to
                reduce bycatch of multiple species.
            -   Required to carry [vessel monitoring
                systems](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/enforcement/vessel-monitoring)
                onboard their boats to ensure compliance with these
                closures.
            -   Required to carry at-sea fisheries observers upon request.
                NOAA Fisheries reviews observer data to monitor protected
                species interactions and takes appropriate action as
                necessary.
            -   Required to install electronic monitoring (cameras) and
                submit camera hard drives to NOAA Fisheries to monitor
                bluefin tuna catch and discards.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Recreational fishermen must have a permit to fish for bigeye
            tuna.
        -   Minimum size limit.
        -   Recreational fishing for highly migratory species such as bigeye
            tuna provides significant economic benefits to coastal
            communities through individual angler expenditures, recreational
            charters, tournaments, and the shoreside businesses that support
            those activities.

        Division](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/atlantic-highly-migratory-species)
        manage the Atlantic bigeye tuna fishery in the United States.
    -   Managed under the [Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species
        Fishery Management
        Plan](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/management-plan/consolidated-atlantic-highly-migratory-species-management-plan):
        -   Commercial fishermen must have a permit to harvest bigeye tuna.
        -   Gear restrictions.
        -   Time/area closures.
        -   Minimum size limit.
        -   Federal management for Atlantic tunas applies to state waters as
            well, except in Maine, Connecticut, and Mississippi. NOAA
            Fisheries periodically reviews these states’ regulations to make
            sure they’re consistent with federal regulations.
    -   Highly migratory species, such as bigeye tuna, have complicated
        management that requires international cooperation.
    -   The United States participates in regional fisheries management
        organizations, such as the [International Commission for the
        Conservation of Atlantic Tunas](https://www.iccat.int/en/) (ICCAT),
        to enhance tuna management worldwide and promote the rigorous
        stewardship standards followed by our own U.S. fishermen.
    -   NOAA Fisheries sets regulations for the U.S. western Atlantic bigeye
        tuna fishery based on our science as well as conservation and
        management measures adopted by ICCAT. ICCAT conservation and
        management recommendations include:
        -   An annual total allowable catch of 65,000 metric tons allocated
            among major harvesters, sharing arrangements for member
            countries, minimum size limits, effort controls, time/area
            closures, trade tracking requirements, compliance measures, and
            monitoring and inspection programs.
        -   ICCAT remains concerned about unreported catches and is actively
            working to improve statistics by working with tuna canneries in
            West Africa.
        -   Since 2011, ICCAT has also instituted numerous requirements
            related to catch reporting and measures to manage the use of
            fishy aggregating devices.
        -   The United States has strongly advocated for management measures
            at ICCAT to end overfishing and rebuild the stock within 10
            years.  NOAA Fisheries will continue to work with ICCAT to
            develop effective measures to end overfishing and to implement
            an international rebuilding program.
    -   In 2000, the United States established the [Dolphin-Safe Tuna
        Tracking and Verification
        Program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/dolphin-safe)
        to monitor the domestic production and importation of all frozen and
        processed tuna products nationwide and to authenticate any
        associated dolphin-safe claim.

    -   Bigeye tuna spawn throughout the year but most often in the summer.
    -   They usually spawn two or more times a year.
    -   Females release between 3 million and 6 million eggs each time they
        spawn.
    -   Bigeye tuna feed near the top of the food chain, preying on fish,
        crustaceans, and squid.
    -   They are prey for many top predators, including sharks, billfish,
        larger tunas, and toothed whales.

  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   U.S. fishermen catch approximately 1 percent of the total
            international catch of North Atlantic albacore.
        -   In 2016, U.S. commercial landings of North Atlantic albacore
            totaled 170 metric tons dressed weight and were valued at
            $563,784.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Albacore in the North Atlantic are most often harvested
            incidentally in the commercial pelagic longline fishery for
            swordfish and other tunas. U.S. commercial fishermen also use
            rod-and-reel gear to catch albacore tuna.
        -   Fishing gear used to catch albacore has no impact on habitat
            because it’s used in the water column and doesn’t come into
            contact with the ocean floor.
        -   Rod-and-reel gear is very selective and bycatch is minimal. U.S.
            commercial fishermen fishing with pelagic longline gear follow a
            number of strict regulations to prevent incidentally catching
            marine mammals, sea turtles, and birds.
        -   NOAA Fisheries has taken the following additional measures to
            prevent bycatch and sustainably manage this fishery. Fishermen
            are:
            -   Required to use large circle hooks and certain types of bait
                that limit gear interactions with sea turtles. Circle hooks
                are specifically designed to minimize the damage caused by
                hooking, giving animals that are captured and released a
                better chance at survival.
            -   Trained to use special techniques to safely dehook and
                release any incidentally caught turtles.
            -   Required to stop fishing and move 1 nautical mile if they
                encounter a protected species.
            -   Required to protect pilot whales and Risso's dolphins when
                fishing in the Mid-Atlantic Bight by limiting the length of
                their lines to 20 nautical miles and posting [marine mammal
                handling/release
                guidelines](http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/interactions/handling_release.pdf)
                on their vessels. In addition, if fishing in the Cape
                Hatteras Special Research Area, pelagic longliners must
                contact NOAA Fisheries at least 48 hours prior to a trip and
                carry observers if requested.
            -   Required to use [weak

                in the Gulf of Mexico to reduce incidental catch of bluefin
                tuna and prohibited from using live bait to reduce bycatch
                of billfish.
            -   Restricted from areas of the Gulf of Mexico to reduce

    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Recreational fishing for highly migratory species such as
            albacore tuna provides significant economic benefits to coastal
            communities through individual angler expenditures, recreational
            charters, tournaments, and the shoreside businesses that support
            those activities. Federal permits are required.

        North Atlantic albacore tuna are not overfished, have rebuilt to
        target population levels, and are not subject to overfishing
    -   The [International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic
        Tunas](http://www.iccat.int/en/) (ICCAT) assesses the abundance of
        North Atlantic albacore tuna and evaluates the sustainability of
        current and proposed harvest practices. They use the scientific
        information from these assessments to make management
        recommendations.
    -   An international rebuilding plan was put in place in 2010. The stock
        was declared rebuilt in 2016, and since then has been managed under
        a conservation and management program.
    -   In 2017, ICCAT adopted an interim Harvest Control Rule (HCR) for
        northern albacore for 2018-2020, consistent with scientific advice,
        with the goal of adopting a long-term HCR following further
        Management Strategy Evaluation testing over the next few years.

    -   Albacore grow relatively fast, up to more than 4 feet and 88 pounds.
    -   In the Atlantic, they live up to 13 years and are able to reproduce
        by age 5.
    -   In the spring and summer, albacore spawn in subtropical waters of
        the Atlantic and throughout the Mediterranean Sea. Depending on
        their size, females have between 2 million and 3 million eggs per
        spawning season.
    -   Similarly sized albacore travel together in schools that can be up
        to 19 miles wide. Schools of albacore also sometimes include other
        tuna species such as skipjack, yellowfin, and bluefin.
    -   Albacore constantly swim with their mouths open in order to breathe
        because they lack the structures needed to pump oxygen-rich water
        over their gills.
    -   They have unique biological characteristics that enable them to swim
        at speeds over 50 miles per hour and cover vast areas during annual
        migrations:
        -   Torpedo-shaped bodies, smooth skin, and streamlined fins.
        -   Highly evolved circulatory system that regulates body
            temperature and increases muscle efficiency.
        -   High metabolism.
        -   High blood pressure, volume, and hemoglobin, all of which
            increase oxygen absorption.
    -   Albacore tuna feed near the top of the food chain, preying upon a
        variety of fish, crustaceans, and squid.
    -   They are prey for many top predators, including sharks, rays, larger
        tunas, and billfishes.

    -   Acadian redfish are orange to flame red, with paler underbellies.
    -   They have a flattened body that is longer than it is deep.
    -   They have large eyes and a large mouth lined with many small teeth.
    -   They have one continuous dorsal fin that runs from the nape of their
        neck to their caudal peduncle (where the body meets the tail) and a
        small tail fin.
    -   Young redfish are marked with patches of black and green pigment.

  health_benefits: |
    Redfish is low in saturated fat. It’s a good source of niacin, vitamins
    B6 and B12, calcium, protein, phosphorus, and selenium.
  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   In 2016, commercial landings of Acadian redfish totaled 8.9
            million pounds and were valued at $5.3 million.
        -   Commercial fishermen harvested 43 percent of their annual catch
            limit in 2016.
        -   NOAA Fisheries has been working with fishermen to increase
            opportunities to harvest redfish.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Redfish are most commonly harvested using trawl nets, although
            they are sometimes also caught using gillnets, bottom longline,
            and rod and reel.
        -   Area closures and gear restrictions reduce habitat impacts from
            trawl nets.
        -   Fishermen follow management measures to designed to reduce
            interactions with marine mammals, including gear modifications,
            seasonal closures, and use of marine mammal deterrents.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Acadian redfish are not a common target of anglers but may be
            encountered when targeting other groundfish species like cod and
            haddock.
        -   [Regulations](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/sustainable/recfishing/regs/index.html)
            are limited to a minimum fish size in federal waters.

    -   Acadian redfish are slow-growing, long-lived fish.
    -   Redfish can grow up to 18 to 20 inches long and live 50 years or
        more.
    -   They mature at a late age (5 to 6 years) and have low reproductive
        rates.
    -   They mate in late autumn and early winter.
    -   Redfish give birth to live young (an unusual feature for fish), and
        fertilization, incubation, and hatching of eggs all occur within the
        female’s body.
    -   Eggs are not fertilized until spring and then incubate for 45 to 60
        days. Females release their hatched larvae from late spring through
        July and August.
    -   Females generally produce between 15,000 and 20,000 larvae per
        spawning cycle.
    -   Newly hatched redfish can swim well at birth and are soon able to
        forage for plankton (tiny floating plants and animals).
    -   Their survival rate is relatively high compared with that of
        egg-laying fish.
    -   Young redfish stay in the upper waters feeding on small crustaceans
        until they are about 2 inches long.
    -   In the fall, the young settle to the ocean bottom.
    -   Older redfish feed on larger invertebrates and small fish.

  habitat: |
    -   Skipjack tuna are a pelagic species. They mostly live in the open
        ocean, but they may spend part of their life in nearshore waters.
    -   They can be found in surface waters and to depths of 850 feet during
        the day and generally stay near the surface at night.
    -   Skipjack tuna is a highly migratory species, swimming long distances
        to feed and reproduce.
    -   They swim in schools, especially around floating objects or
        hydrographic features such as convergence zones and boundaries
        between cold and warm water masses. They also school around
        upwelling areas, where dense, cooler, and usually nutrient-rich
        water is pushed toward the ocean surface, replacing the warmer,
        usually nutrient-depleted surface water.

        devices](http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/interactions/gear/fads.htm)
        (FADs) intentionally placed in the water to attract fish. Foreign
        purse seiners and baitboats have used FADs extensively in the
        Atlantic since the early 1990s to catch skipjack, primarily off the
        coast of West Africa. Researchers have found that the increasing use
        of FADs has changed the species composition of tuna catches,
        resulting in a higher capture rate of juvenile
        [yellowfin](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/atlantic-yellowfin-tuna)
        and
        [bigeye](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/atlantic-bigeye-tuna) tuna
        for vessels targeting skipjack. The increased presence of FADs may
        also have an impact on the biology and ecology of skipjack, bigeye,
        and yellowfin tuna. Also, sea turtles and marine mammals can become
        entangled in nets, ropes, and lines that are used in the FADs.

    Skipjack is an excellent source of low-fat protein.
  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   Skipjack tuna are caught by U.S. vessels in the western North
            Atlantic, but are only a minor component of total U.S. tuna
            landings and a very small percentage of the total international
            landings of western Atlantic skipjack tuna.
        -   In 2015, the United States contributed about 0.4 percent of the
            total western Atlantic skipjack landings and 0.03 percent of
            total Atlantic skipjack landings.
        -   In 2015, commercial landings of Atlantic skipjack totaled 1.5
            metric tons dressed weight and were valued at $2,269.
        -   Almost all of the U.S. commercial harvest of skipjack tuna comes
            from the
            [Pacific](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/pacific-skipjack-tuna).
            Much of it is exported to foreign markets.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   In the Atlantic, U.S. commercial fishermen mainly use handgear
            to harvest skipjack tuna.
        -   Handgear includes rod-and-reel and handline gear, which consists
            of a mainline that is retrieved by hand with no more than two
            hooks attached.
        -   Handgear is highly selective and does not contact the ocean
            floor.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   U.S. recreational fishermen account for more of the total catch
            of skipjack tuna in the western Atlantic than commercial
            fishermen.
        -   Recreational fishermen must have a permit to fish for skipjack
            tuna.
        -   Recreational fishing for highly migratory species such as
            skipjack tuna provides significant economic benefits to coastal
            communities through individual angler expenditures, recreational
            charters, tournaments, and the shoreside businesses that support
            those activities.

    -   According to the 2014 [stock
        assessment](http://www.iccat.int/Documents/Meetings/Docs/2014_SKJ_ASSESS_ENG.pdf),
        Atlantic skipjack tuna are not overfished and are not subject to
        overfishing.
    -   The [International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic
        Tunas](http://www.iccat.int/en/) (ICCAT) assesses the abundance of
        Atlantic skipjack tuna and evaluates the sustainability of current
        and proposed harvest practices. They use the scientific information
        from these assessments to make management recommendations.
    -   It’s difficult to assess the abundance of skipjack tuna due to its
        unique biological and fishery characteristics. Various assessment
        methods are used for skipjack tuna to overcome these difficulties,
        and several fishery indicators are analyzed for evidence of changes
        in the state of the stock over time.

        Highly Migratory Species
        Division](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/atlantic-highly-migratory-species)
        manage the Atlantic skipjack tuna fishery in the United States.
    -   Managed under the [Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species
        Fishery Management
        Plan](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/management-plan/consolidated-atlantic-highly-migratory-species-management-plan):
        -   Commercial fishermen must have a permit to harvest skipjack.
        -   Gear restrictions.
        -   Federal management for Atlantic tunas applies to state waters as
            well, except in Maine, Connecticut, and Mississippi. NOAA
            Fisheries periodically reviews these states’ regulations to make
            sure they’re consistent with federal regulations.
    -   Highly migratory species, such as skipjack tuna have complicated
        management that requires international cooperation.
    -   The United States participates in regional fisheries management
        organizations, such as the [International Commission for the
        Conservation of Atlantic Tunas](http://www.iccat.int/en/) (ICCAT),
        to enhance tuna management worldwide. NOAA Fisheries sets
        regulations for the U.S. western Atlantic skipjack tuna fishery
        based on our science as well as conservation and management measures
        adopted by ICCAT.
        -   No specific ICCAT management measures currently apply to
            skipjack tuna.
        -   In 2013, ICCAT adopted a measure to expand reporting
            requirements for tropical tuna fisheries using [fish aggregating
            devices](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/bycatch/fishing-gear-fish-aggregating-devices)
            (FADs). The measure will improve data collection and allow ICCAT
            scientists to better characterize the fishing effort associated
            with FAD fishing.

    -   Like other tropical tunas, skipjack tuna grow fast, up to over 3
        feet and 40 pounds, and have a relatively short life span, around 7
        years.
    -   In the eastern Atlantic, skipjack are able to reproduce when they’re
        1 year old. They spawn throughout the year in tropical waters and
        seasonally (spring to early fall) in subtropical areas.
    -   Depending on their size, females can produce between 100,000 and 2
        million eggs per year.
    -   Skipjack spawn more than once a season, as often as once per day.
    -   Once fertilized, the eggs hatch in about 1 day (depending on the
        temperature).
    -   Skipjack tuna are opportunistic feeders, preying on a variety of
        fish (e.g., herrings), crustaceans, cephalopods, mollusks, and
        sometimes other skipjack tunas.
    -   Large pelagic fishes such as billfish, sharks, and other large tunas
        prey on skipjack tuna.

  physical_description: |
    -   <https://habcam.whoi.edu/>Scallops are bivalves (having two shells),
        like clams and oysters.
    -   The shells are held together by the adductor muscle (the part of the
        scallop Americans typically eat).
    -   Sea scallops have a saucer-shaped shell with scalloped or fluted
        edges.
    -   The upper shell is usually reddish-pink or brown in color. The lower
        shell is white or cream.
    -   A small percentage (5-10 percent) of sea scallops are albinos, with
        white upper and lower shells.
    -   Sea scallop shells are smooth and lack the prominent ribbing that is
        characteristic of most other scallop shells. It is thought that the
        sea scallop’s smooth shell is an adaptation to allow it to propel
        itself faster and farther.

    -   Adult scallops live close together in groups called “beds,” on sandy
        or gravelly parts of the ocean floor.
    -   They are generally found at depths of about 100 to 300 feet on
        Georges Bank and in the Mid-Atlantic.
    -   Sea scallops can be found in shallower waters in Maine and Canada.

  research: |
    -   Scientists from NOAA’s [Northeast Fisheries Science
        Center](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/) have surveyed the Atlantic sea
        scallop population off the northeastern U.S. coast between North
        Carolina and Massachusetts every year since 1979. They divide the
        survey area into zones of various depths and habitat, then tow a
        dredge and camera to randomly sample and document the marine life
        and other conditions in these zones. After each tow, they sort,
        count, and measure their catch. Dredge catches provide relative
        indices of the average density of animals, along with some
        information about bottom type and habitat.
    -   Scientists have recently started using a new undersea camera called
        the “[HabCam](http://habcam.whoi.edu/)” in scallop surveys to
        supplement the dredge data. The HabCam (short for Habitat Mapping
        Camera System) was developed by scientists at Woods Hole
        Oceanographic Institution working with Cape Cod scallop fishermen.
        Images from the HabCam supply absolute densities of scallops and
        other species, are less labor intensive in terms of crew, and
        provide much more information about the bottom habitat, all in
        near-real time. Using both the annual dredge surveys and the HabCam
        provides a more complete picture of the scallop population and its
        habitat.
    -   Scientists use information from these surveys along with data from
        other surveys and the commercial fishery to estimate abundance
        (biomass) and assess the health of the population and the
        sustainability of the fishery.
    -   Under the [Scallop Research Set-Aside
        Program](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/sustainable/research/index.html),
        1.25 million pounds (567 metric tons) of the allowed scallop harvest
        is set aside each year to fund scallop and habitat research and
        surveys to provide better information for future management
        decisions. This is not a federally-funded program. Participating
        scallop vessels fund research through the sale of the scallops they
        harvest. Past projects have focused on gear research to minimize
        bycatch of finfish, sea turtles, and small scallops; surveys of
        rotational access areas and other areas; studies of scallop
        biology; and development of survey technologies.

  health_benefits: |
    Scallops are a good low-fat source of protein and are high in selenium

  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   In 2017, commercial landings of Atlantic sea scallop totaled
            more than 51.4 million pounds of sea scallop meats and were
            valued at more than $506 million.
        -   Scallop vessels from Massachusetts, Virginia, and New Jersey are
            responsible for the majority of the U.S. harvest.
        -   The principal U.S. commercial fisheries for sea scallop are in
            the Mid-Atlantic (from Virginia to Long Island, New York) and on
            Georges Bank and neighboring areas, such as the Great South
            Channel and Nantucket Shoals. There is also a small, primarily
            inshore fishery for sea scallops in the Gulf of Maine.
        -   The U.S. sea scallop fishery is extremely important to the U.S.
            economy and is the largest wild scallop fishery in the world.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   U.S. commercial fishermen harvest sea scallops year-round,
            primarily using turtle deflector–style scallop dredges that
            catch scallops much like rakes collect leaves.
        -   A small number of fishermen use otter trawls, mostly in the
            Mid-Atlantic.
        -   Divers and Digby dredges are sometimes used in near-shore areas
            in the Gulf of Maine.
        -   The bottom fishing gears used to harvest scallops, such as
            dredges and trawls, can remove some bottom habitat–forming
            organisms, including tubeworms and sponges.
        -   Managers have implemented a variety of measures to protect
            habitat from potential impacts of [fishing
            gear](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/sustainable/species/scallop/):
            -   Several areas are closed year-round to harvesting scallops
                to protect sensitive habitat.
            -   Managers have implemented a rotational access area program,
                which restricts where and when scallop vessels can fish,
                benefitting both habitat and scallop populations.
            -   Fishermen use 4-inch rings in their scallop dredges that
                increase the dredges’ efficiency, catching larger scallops
                and allowing smaller scallops and other small marine life to
                return to the sea floor by passing through the dredge rings.
                The 4-inch rings reduce the amount of time dredges contact
                the bottom.
        -   Sea turtles, finfish (such as yellowtail flounder, skates, and
            monkfish), and undersized scallops can be incidentally caught in
            the scallop fishery.
        -   Managers seasonally prohibit fishing in areas where finfish
            species congregate, reducing catch of these untargeted species.
        -   Scallop fishermen receive annual allocations of windowpane and
            yellowtail flounder that they can catch. If the catches are
            exceeded, managers will implement measures to minimize catch of
            these species in a future fishing year (e.g., gear restrictions
            and seasonal closures).
        -   Scallop vessels in the Mid-Atlantic must use a [turtle deflector
            dredge](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/nero/nr/nrdoc/12/12ScalFW23PHL.pdf) and
            chain mat when and where sea turtles occur on scallop grounds.
            The turtle deflector dredge excludes sea turtles from being
            caught in the dredge and prevents serious injuries to the
            turtles.
        -   Scallop dredges using “twine-tops” must adhere to gear
            modifications designed to allow fish to escape.
        -   Research and experimentation with different techniques and
            gears, as well as education efforts, have helped reduce bycatch.
        -   Managers and the fishing industry continue to collaborate to
            redesign scallop dredges to reduce flounder bycatch and to
            minimize injuries to and capture of sea turtles.

            depending on their permit type and historical catch, through
            days-at-sea and number of trips to special access areas.
        -   Other management measures include:
            -   Limits on crew size.
            -   Areas closed to scallop dredging to allow young scallops to
                grow large and reproduce, and to reduce bycatch of
                non-targeted species.
            -   Vessels harvesting scallops must use [vessel monitoring

    -   Sea scallops can live up to 20 years. They grow quickly for the
        first few years of their life.
    -   The largest scallop ever reported was about 9 inches in shell
        height, but they typically don’t grow larger than 6 inches.
    -   Sea scallops can reproduce by age 2, but don’t produce many eggs or
        sperm until they are about 4 years old.
    -   They are very fertile—a female sea scallop can produce hundreds of
        millions of eggs per year. For this reason, scallops may respond
        more rapidly to management actions than species that reproduce
        slowly and in small numbers.
    -   Sea scallops usually spawn in late summer or early fall. They also
        may spawn in the spring, especially in the Mid-Atlantic Bight.
    -   After hatching, scallop larvae remain in the water column for 4 to 6
        weeks before settling on the ocean floor.
    -   Sea scallops feed by filtering phytoplankton or other small
        organisms out of the water column, which can actually help to
        improve water quality by removing suspended materials.
    -   Many kinds of pelagic fish and invertebrates eat scallop larvae.
    -   Cod, wolffish, eel pout, flounder, crabs, lobster, sea turtles, and
        sea stars feed on juvenile and adult scallops.
    -   Using its adductor muscle to snap its top and bottom shells open and
        shut, a sea scallop can propel itself through the water. This helps
        them escape predators, such as sea stars, that other bivalves like
        mussels, clams, and oysters can’t avoid.

    -   Atlantic salmon have a spindle-like body shape – rounded, broad in
        the middle, and tapered at each end. The shape is somewhat flattened
        toward the sides, which is typical of salmon species.
    -   The head is relatively small, about one-fifth of the body length.
        The underside paired fins are prominent, especially on juveniles.
    -   Spawning adults darken to a bronze color after entering freshwater
        and darken further after they spawn. When spawning has been
        completed, they are often referred to as kelts or black salmon. 
        Their silver color returns after they re-enter the sea.

  location: |
    -   Atlantic salmon are the only salmon native to the Atlantic Ocean.
    -   There are three groups of wild Atlantic salmon: North American,
        European, and Baltic. The North American group, including the
        Canadian and U.S. populations, was historically found from northern
        Quebec southeast to Newfoundland and southwest to Long Island Sound.
    -   In the United States, Atlantic salmon were once native to almost
        every river north of the Hudson River. Due to the effects of
        industrial and agricultural development (including habitat
        destruction, dams, and historic overfishing), most populations
        native to New England were eradicated. Now, the only native
        populations of Atlantic salmon in the United States are found in
        Maine.

  habitat: |
    -   Atlantic salmon are anadromous – they leave the ocean to return to
        freshwater streams and rivers to breed.
    -   After hatching, young Atlantic salmon (called parr) remain in rivers
        or streams for the first 1 to 2 years of life, preferring shallow,
        cool, fast-flowing water with shade.
    -   After this period, the salmon migrate to open ocean waters where
        they spend about 2 to 3 years feeding, then return to their natal
        streams or rivers to spawn during the fall.

    -   For salmon in Maine, most current research focuses on two priorities
        – the impact of dams on populations and survival of salmon in the
        ocean. See [NOAA Fisheries Northeast Salmon
        Team](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/salmon/).
    -   Atlantic salmon may be facing new challenges in the Gulf of Maine
        due to changing environmental conditions. Increasing numbers of
        hatchery-raised Atlantic salmon smolts are entering the ocean via
        the Gulf of Maine, but fewer are returning to spawn, raising
        questions as to what is happening to these fish at sea. A [2011
        study](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/press_release/2011/SciSpot/SS1107/)
        co-authored by a NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center researcher
        suggests that changing spring wind patterns, warming sea surface
        temperatures, and new predators along altered migration routes are
        affecting the survival of Atlantic salmon.

    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   There is no commercial catch of wild Atlantic salmon in the
            United States.
        -   Atlantic salmon were a highly prized game and food fish.
        -   They were caught by Native Americans before the first settlers
            arrived, and commercial fisheries for Atlantic salmon started in
            Maine during the 1600s.
        -   Around the time of the American Revolution, weirs (an enclosure
            of stakes set in a stream as a trap for fish) became the gear of
            choice in U.S. Atlantic salmon commercial fisheries and were
            modified as more effective materials and designs became
            available.
        -   Catches in Maine exceeded 90 metric tons in the late 1800s and
            45 metric tons in some years during the early 1900s.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Recreational fishermen have reportedly been angling for Atlantic
            salmon since 1832, when the first Atlantic salmon caught on
            rod-and-reel gear was captured in the Dennys River in Maine.
        -   Recreational fisheries are closed in the United States, with the
            exception of some landlocked fisheries for Atlantic salmon in
            New Hampshire, where fish retired from hatchery broodstock are
            released for angling.

    -   The U.S. Atlantic Salmon Assessment Committee, a team of state and

        report](https://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/USASAC/Reports/USASAC2019-Report-31-2018-Activities.pdf)
        indicates that returns remain at historically low levels.
    -   Scientists determine the population status by counting the number of
        adults that return to spawn, either directly at traps and weirs or
        indirectly using nest surveys and modeling.
    -   Atlantic salmon stocks began to decline in the mid-1800s due to a

        the [New England Fishery Management
        Council](https://www.nefmc.org/), and the [State of
        Maine](http://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html) manage Atlantic
        salmon.
    -   Managed under the [Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic
        Salmon](https://www.nefmc.org/management-plans/atlantic-salmon):
        -   Prohibits possession of wild Atlantic salmon and any directed or
            incidental Atlantic salmon catch in federal waters.
        -   All Atlantic salmon caught incidentally in other fisheries must
            be released in a manner that ensures maximum probability of
            survival. This protects Atlantic salmon in U.S. marine waters
            and complements management in state-managed riverine and coastal
            waters.
    -   In 2000, NOAA Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
        listed the Gulf of Maine distinct population segment of Atlantic
        salmon as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. The two
        agencies are jointly responsible for the recovery of this endangered
        population of Atlantic salmon.
    -   In December 2005, the agencies, in coordination with the State of
        Maine, finalized the Recovery Plan for the Gulf of Maine distinct
        population segment. This plan identifies recovery actions needed to
        halt the decline of the species and lays out a process to minimize
        threats.
    -   In June 2009, they extended Endangered Species Act protection to
        more Atlantic salmon, adding fish in the Penobscot, Kennebec, and
        Androscoggin rivers and their tributaries to the endangered Gulf of
        Maine distinct population segment. Protection also applies wherever
        these fish are found, including these rivers’ estuaries and marine
        environment.
    -   A new recovery plan is being developed to reflect the expanded range
        of endangered salmon and the designation of their critical habitat
        (the area needed to support the fish population’s survival and
        recovery).
    -   In 2015, NOAA Fisheries announced a new program to focus and
        redouble our efforts to protect eight species that are currently
        among the most at risk of extinction in the near future. This 5-year
        action plan focuses on priority actions for Atlantic salmon.
        [Species in the
        Spotlight](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/atlantic-salmon-protected/spotlight)
    -   International management:
        -   Because Atlantic salmon migrate all along the North American
            coast, the United States joined with other North Atlantic
            nations in 1984 to form the [North Atlantic Salmon Conservation
            Organization](http://www.nasco.int/) (NASCO) to cooperatively
            manage Atlantic salmon stocks through conservation, restoration,
            and enhancement programs.
        -   The United States’ participation in NASCO supports the long-term
            commitment by the states and federal government to rehabilitate
            and restore U.S. Atlantic salmon stocks.
        -   The [International Council for the Exploration of the
            Sea](http://www.ices.dk/Pages/default.aspx) (ICES) is the
            official research arm of NASCO. ICES provides scientific advice
            to NASCO members to inform science-based management
            recommendations for the conservation of North Atlantic salmon
            stocks.
    -   Substantial efforts are ongoing to restore wild Atlantic salmon and
        their habitat. These include improving fish passage by removing or
        modifying dams so salmon can reach freshwater spawning and rearing
        areas critical to their survival, understanding and improving
        historically low salmon survival in the ocean, and supplementing
        wild populations with hatchery-raised Atlantic salmon.
    -   Atlantic salmon have been raised in hatcheries since 1864 to enhance
        wild populations. Today, these hatcheries help to prevent further
        decline of Atlantic salmon and subsequently prevent their
        extinction.
    -   In the late 1970s, commercial aquaculture ventures started rearing
        Atlantic salmon in Maine. See [Atlantic Salmon –
        Farmed](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/atlantic-salmon-farmed) for

  biology: |
    -   Atlantic salmon are anadromous – they leave the ocean to return to
        freshwater streams and rivers to breed.
    -   Females lay an average of 7,500 eggs in gravel nests, called redds.
    -   Eggs incubate slowly due to cold winter water temperatures. About 9
        to 20 percent of the eggs survive to the fry stage.
    -   Fry remain buried in the gravel for about 6 weeks and emerge in
        mid-May.
    -   They quickly disperse from the redds and develop camouflaging
        stripes along their sides, entering the parr stage.
    -   Parr eventually undergo a physiological transformation called
        smoltification that prepares them for life in a marine habitat.
        During smoltification, fish imprint on the chemical nature of the
        stream or river to enable them to find their way back to where they
        were born. After smoltfication is complete in the spring, smolts
        migrate to the ocean to grow, feed, and mature.
    -   Atlantic salmon growth rates are variable and depend on several
        factors including season, habitat quality, age, sex, and population
        density.
    -   They grow much faster in saltwater than in freshwater. After 2 years
        at sea, adult salmon can grow to an average length of 28 to 30
        inches and weight of 8 to 12 pounds.
    -   Unlike the Pacific salmon species, Atlantic salmon do not die after
        spawning, and adults can repeat the breeding cycle. They live for 4
        to 6 years.
    -   Juvenile Atlantic salmon mostly prey on invertebrates and
        terrestrial insects while in freshwater and on amphipods (small,
        shrimp-like crustaceans), krill, and fishes while at sea.
    -   Larger adult Atlantic salmon mainly prey on fish such as Atlantic
        herring, alewife, rainbow smelt, capelin, mummichogs, sand lances,
        flatfish, and small Atlantic mackerel.
    -   Birds, marine mammals, and fish prey on Atlantic salmon.

    -   Pollock eggs and larvae are found in the water column.
    -   Juveniles are found inshore and move offshore as they grow older.
        When in inshore waters, juvenile pollock school in the open water at
        low tide, then scatter at high tide and hide in intertidal seaweed
        beds.
    -   Adults live offshore near the ocean floor over a wide variety of
        ocean bottom habitats including sand, mud, rocks, and vegetation.
    -   Atlantic pollock swim in schools and are believed to travel
        extensively between the Scotian Shelf and Georges Bank and, to a
        lesser extent, between the Scotian Shelf and the Gulf of Maine.

    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   The 2016 commercial landings of Atlantic pollock totaled more
            than 5.7 million pounds and were valued at $6.5 million.
        -   Commercial fishermen harvested 17% of their annual catch limit
            in 2016.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Pollock are commonly harvested using trawl nets, gillnets,
            bottom longlines, and rod and reel.
        -   Gillnets, longlines, and rod and reel used to harvest pollock
            have little to no impact on habitat.
        -   Areas closures and gear restrictions reduce habitat impacts from
            trawl nets.
        -   Fishermen follow management measures to designed to reduce
            interactions with marine mammals, including gear modifications,
            seasonal closures, and use of marine mammal deterrents.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Pollock is growing in popularity with anglers that have
            traditionally targeted other groundfish like cod and haddock.
            Anglers target pollock from boats and shore using both lures and
            bait. Successful anglers find that the fish puts up a spirited
            fight. Fishing occurs year-round.
        -   [Regulations](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/sustainable/recfishing/regs/index.html)

  taste: |
    Yellowfin tuna has a mild, meaty flavor. It’s more flavorful than
    albacore, but leaner than [bluefin
    tuna](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/western-atlantic-bluefin-tuna).
  health_benefits: |
    Yellowfin tuna is low in saturated fat and sodium and is a very good
    source of protein, thiamin, selenium, vitamin B6, and omega-3s.
  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   U.S. landings of Atlantic yellowfin tuna represent a small
            percentage of the total international landings of Atlantic
            yellowfin tuna. In 2015, the United States contributed about
            2 percent of the total Atlantic yellowfin tuna landings.
        -   In 2015, commercial landings of Atlantic yellowfin tuna totaled
            891 metric tons dressed weight and were valued at $8.5 million.
        -   Yellowfin tuna is the principal species of tropical tuna landed
            by U.S. fisheries in the western North Atlantic.
        -   The majority of U.S. commercial landings come from the longline
            fleet operating in the northwest Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and
            Caribbean.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   U.S. commercial fishermen primarily use longline, rod-and-reel,
            and handline gear to harvest Atlantic yellowfin tuna.
        -   Pelagic longline gear and handgear (handline and rod-and-reel)
            used to catch yellowfin tuna have no impact on habitat because
            they’re used in the water column and don’t come into contact
            with the ocean floor.
        -   Handgear is very selective so bycatch is minimal, but pelagic
            longlines can incidentally catch other fish and protected
            species such as marine mammals and sea turtles.
        -   NOAA Fisheries has taken the following additional measures to
            prevent bycatch and sustainably manage this fishery. Fishermen
            are:
            -   Required to use large circle hooks and certain types of bait
                that limit gear interactions with sea turtles. Circle hooks
                are specifically designed to minimize the damage caused by
                hooking, giving animals that are captured and released a
                better chance at survival.
            -   Trained to use special techniques to safely dehook and
                release any incidentally caught turtles.
            -   Required to stop fishing and move 1 nautical mile if they
                encounter a protected species.
            -   Required to protect pilot whales and Risso's dolphins when
                fishing in the Mid-Atlantic Bight by limiting the length of
                their lines to 20 nautical miles and posting [marine mammal
                handling/release
                guidelines](http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/interactions/handling_release.pdf)
                on their vessels. In addition, if fishing in the Cape
                Hatteras Special Research Area, pelagic longliners must
                contact NOAA Fisheries at least 48 hours prior to a trip and
                carry observers if requested.
            -   Required to use weak hooks in the Gulf of Mexico to reduce
                incidental catch of bluefin tuna and prohibited from using
                live bait to reduce bycatch of billfish.
            -   Restricted from areas of the Gulf of Mexico to reduce
                bycatch of all species.
            -   Required to carry [vessel monitoring
                systems](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/enforcement/vessel-monitoring)
                onboard their boats to ensure compliance with these
                closures.
            -   Required to carry at-sea fisheries observers upon request.
                NOAA Fisheries reviews observer data to monitor protected
                species interactions and takes appropriate action as
                necessary.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   A high proportion of landings are rod-and-reel catches by
            recreational anglers.
        -   In 2015, recreational fishermen caught 936 metric tons of
            yellowfin tuna.
        -   Recreational fishermen enjoy catching yellowfin tuna because
            they’re large (up to 400 pounds) and they fight hard.
        -   Recreational fishermen must have a permit to catch yellowfin
            tuna.
        -   They have daily bag limits. However, catch, tag, and release is
            allowed.
        -   Recreational fishing for highly migratory species such as
            yellowfin tuna provides significant economic benefits to coastal
            communities through individual angler expenditures, recreational
            charters, tournaments, and the shoreside businesses that support
            those activities.

    -   According to the 2016 [stock
        assessment](http://www.iccat.int/en/assess.htm), Atlantic yellowfin
        tuna are not overfished and are not subject to overfishing.
    -   The [International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic
        Tunas](http://www.iccat.int/en/) (ICCAT) assesses the abundance of
        Atlantic yellowfin tuna and evaluates the sustainability of current
        and proposed harvest practices. They use the scientific information
        from these assessments to make management recommendations.
    -   Scientists estimate the stock is approximately 5 percent below the
        target level. The stock is considered overfished based on the ICCAT
        definition because ICCAT does not set different levels for the
        target population level and the overfished level. This means that
        stocks that are not at the target population level are also regarded
        as overfished by ICCAT. NOAA Fisheries sets the overfished level at
        50 percent of the population level, so according to their
        definition, the stock is not overfished.

            tuna.
        -   Gear restrictions.
        -   Time/area closures.
        -   Minimum size limit.
        -   Federal management for Atlantic tunas applies to state waters as
            well, except in Maine, Connecticut, and Mississippi. NOAA
            Fisheries periodically reviews these states’ regulations to make
            sure they’re consistent with federal regulations.
    -   Highly migratory species, such as yellowfin tuna, have complicated
        management that requires international cooperation.
    -   The United States participates in regional fisheries management
        organizations, such as the [International Commission for the
        Conservation of Atlantic Tunas](http://www.iccat.int/en/) (ICCAT),
        to enhance tuna management worldwide. NOAA Fisheries sets
        regulations for the U.S. western Atlantic yellowfin tuna fishery
        based on our science as well as conservation and management measures
        adopted by ICCAT.
    -   In 2011, ICCAT adopted new yellowfin tuna management standards that
        reduced the catch of small yellowfin off West Africa and brought
        other fishing nations closer to U.S. standards.
    -   In 2013, ICCAT adopted a measure to expand reporting requirements
        for tropical tuna fisheries using [fish aggregating
        devices](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/bycatch/fishing-gear-fish-aggregating-devices)
        (FADs). The measure will improve data collection and allow ICCAT
        scientists to better characterize the fishing effort associated with
        FAD fishing.
    -   In 2000, the United States established the [Dolphin-Safe Tuna
        Tracking and Verification
        Program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-mammal-protection/dolphin-safe)
        to monitor the domestic production and importation of all frozen and

    -   Yellowfin tuna grow fairly fast, up to 400 pounds, and have a
        somewhat short life span of about 7 years.
    -   Most yellowfin tuna are able to reproduce when they reach age 2
        or 3.
    -   In the western Atlantic, they spawn from May to August in the Gulf
        of Mexico and from July to November in the southeastern Caribbean.
        In the eastern Atlantic, they spawn from October to March in the
        Gulf of Guinea and from April to June off Senegal.
    -   Females spawn about once every 3 days during the spawning season.
        They produce an average of 1 million to 4 million eggs each time
        they spawn.
    -   Yellowfin tuna feed near the top of the food chain on fish, squid,
        and crustaceans.
    -   They are prey for top predators such as sharks and large fish.

  physical_description: |
    -   Longfin squid have an internal shell called a “pen.”
    -   Their fins are long, at least half the length of the mantle (large
        part of the squid in front of the head).
    -   The head has large eyes that are covered by a cornea.
    -   They are pink or orange and mottled with brown or purple.
    -   They are likely color blind, but are able to use special pigment
        cells in their skin (called chromatophores) to change their color
        and patterns to escape predators or disguise themselves from prey.

    -   Adults live over mud or sand/mud substrates of the continental shelf
        and upper continental slope in waters as deep as 1,300 feet.
    -   Adults and juveniles migrate vertically in the water column,
        remaining near the seabed during the day and moving toward the
        surface at night. 
    -   North of Cape Hatteras, squid migrate seasonally—offshore during
        late autumn to spend the winter in warmer waters along the shelf
        edge and slope, and back inshore during the spring where they remain
        until late autumn.
    -   Squid egg masses are attached to rocks and small boulders or aquatic
        vegetation and on sandy bottoms.
    -   Paralarvae are found in surface waters. Juveniles also live in the
        upper water column in water 165 to 1,650 feet deep.

  harvest: |
    -   In 2017, commercial landings totaled approximately 18 million
        pounds, and were valued at more than $25 million.
    -   Fisheries for longfin squid reflect the species’ seasonal
        migrations.
    -   The majority of landings come from Rhode Island, New York, New
        Jersey, and Massachusetts.
    -   Harvested for bait since the late 1800s, longfin squid have been
        harvested since the mid-1960’s for their mild, sweet meat.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   The majority of longfin squid is harvested year-round using
            small-mesh bottom trawls. There are now only a few fishermen
            that use pound nets and fish traps during the spring and early
            summer when squid migrate inshore.
        -   Sandy or muddy habitat, where squid are fished, is less
            sensitive to the impacts of trawling.
        -   Small-mesh bottom trawls can incidentally catch marine mammals
            and large pelagic species, including pilot whales, common
            dolphin, swordfish, and a variety of shark, ray, and tuna
            species. Finfish such as butterfish, hakes, Illex squid, fluke,
            herring, spiny dogfish, and Atlantic mackerel are also
            incidentally caught in this fishery.
        -   Measures to prevent or minimize bycatch include:
            -   Bycatch cap for
                [butterfish](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/butterfish)
                caught in the longfin fishery.
            -   Minimum mesh size requirements for bottom trawl nets, but
                bycatch escapement is very limited because the codend mesh
                sizes are very small (1 7/8 in. during Trimester 2 and 2 1/8
                in. during Trimesters 1 and 3) and are covered by an
                additional layer of mesh called a strengthener.
            -   Outreach to fishermen to educate them on actions to take in
                the event of a marine mammal interaction.
            -   Real-time communication to vessels regarding hotspots of
                marine mammal interactions.

  biology: |
    -   Longfin squid grow fast, up to 1.6 feet mantle length (large part of
        the squid in front of the head), but usually less than 1 foot.
    -   They have a short life span, reproducing right before they die at
        around six to eight months old.
    -   Their growth and development is highly sensitive to environmental
        conditions. Squid hatched in the summer grow faster than those
        hatched in the winter. 
    -   They spawn year-round, with peak production in winter and summer.
        The male cements bundles of spermatophores into the mantle cavity of
        the female and/or deposits them in a pouch located near her mouth.
        The spermatophores penetrate the ova, or sperm is stored for later
        use. 
    -   The female lays fertilized egg capsules that contain about 150 to
        200 eggs each in clusters attached to the ocean bottom, with a
        typical female laying a total of 3,000 to 6,000 eggs. Eggs hatch
        between 11 and 26 days later, depending on water temperature.
    -   Small immature longfin squid feed on plankton, and larger squid feed
        on crustaceans and small fish.
    -   They are aggressive hunters, can consume fish larger than
        themselves, and do eat their own species.
    -   They are a key prey species for a variety of marine mammals, diving
        birds, and finfish species.

  physical_description: |
    -   Scup are deep-bodied (deeper from back to belly than they are wide).
    -   They are dusky brown with bright silvery reflections below and spiny
        fins.
    -   Adult fins are mottled with dark brown, and young scup fins may be
        faintly barred.
    -   Scup’s front teeth are very narrow, almost conical, and they have
        two rows of molars in the upper jaw.
    -   Longspine porgy look similar to scup, but can be easily identified
        by the elongated spines on their backs.
  human_health:
  texture: Scup have lean and flaky flesh, but also contain many bones, which makes
    them difficult to fillet. As a result, scup are generally sold and
    cooked whole, after they’ve been scaled and dressed.

  management:
  habitat: |
    -   Scup eggs and larvae are found in the water column in coastal waters
        during warmer months.
    -   As larvae mature, they settle to the seafloor and develop into
        juveniles.
    -   Juveniles live in a variety of habitats including rocky ledges,
        artificial reefs, mussel beds, sand, silty sand, shell, mud bottoms,
        and eelgrass.
    -   During the summer and early fall, juveniles and adults are common in
        large estuaries, open sandy bottoms, and structured habitats such as
        mussel beds, reefs, or rock rubble.
    -   Scup migrate north and inshore to spawn in the spring, then migrate
        south and offshore in autumn as the water cools, arriving by
        December in offshore areas where they spend the winter.

        run by states and universities and catch data from the commercial
        and recreational fisheries, help scientists estimate the abundance
        of scup and other species in the Mid-Atlantic and New England.
    -   The Northeast Fisheries Science Center’s [Fishery Observer

    Scup is a low-sodium, low-fat source of protein. It is high in niacin,
    phosphorus, vitamins B6 and B12, and selenium.
  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   In 2016, commercial landings of scup totaled approximately 15.76
            million pounds and were valued at $10.7 million.
        -   The top five states for commercial scup landings are Rhode
            Island, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.
        -   The commercial fishery accounts for about 80 percent of the
            total catch of scup.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   About 75 percent of commercial scup landings are caught with
            otter trawls.
        -   Otter trawls can impact bottom habitat. Scup are mainly
            harvested over sand and mud habitats, which appear to be more
            resilient to the effects of trawling than more structured
            habitats, such as gravel or coral.
        -   Otter trawls can incidentally catch undersized scup. Minimum
            mesh size regulations and time and area restrictions for trawl
            nets help to reduce incidental catch of undersized scup.
        -   The rest of the commercial harvest is mainly caught with
            floating traps and hand lines.
        -   Floating traps are anchored to the bottom in inshore waters in
            the migratory path of scup. Fishermen check on the traps daily
            to sort their catch.
        -   Paired trawl nets, pound nets, and pots catch a small percentage
            of the commercial harvest.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   In 2016, recreational anglers landed approximately 2.8 million
            pounds of scup.
        -   The top three states for recreational scup landings are New
            York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.
        -   In the Mid-Atlantic and southern New England, the recreational
            scup fishery is managed under separate regulations for federal
            and state waters.
        -   Managers set regulations for the recreational fishery annually.
            They include a combination of an annual catch quota, minimum
            size limits, bag limits, and fishing seasons.
        -   For-hire recreational vessels must have a permit to fish in
            federal waters.
        -   In the South Atlantic, there is a limit on the amount of scup
            recreational fishermen can keep and restrictions on the type of
            gear they can use.

        and are not subject to overfishing. The population status for scup
        has not been assessed in the South Atlantic region.
    -   With greatly improved reproduction and survival rates and low

        measure of the amount of scup able to reproduce) has steadily
        increased since the mid-1990s, up to about 190,000 metric tons in

        cooperatively manage the scup fishery north of Cape Hatteras, North
        Carolina.
    -   Individual states may set different regulations for the commercial
        scup fishery. Where state measures differ from federal regulations,
        federally permitted fishery participants must adhere to the more
        restrictive measures.
    -   Managed under the [Summer Flounder, Scup, and Black Sea Bass Fishery
        Management Plan](http://www.mafmc.org/sf-s-bsb/):
        -   Annual commercial quota is divided into three harvest periods:
            Winter I (January–April), Summer (May–October), and Winter II
            (November–December).
        -   The Commission manages the summer quota with individual state
            quotas.
        -   NOAA Fisheries monitors commercial harvests and closes the
            federal scup fishery when the quotas are reached.
        -   Minimum size limits to prevent the harvest of young fish that
            likely haven’t yet reproduced.
        -   Minimum mesh size requirements for trawl nets to reduce bycatch
            of undersized scup.
        -   Scup pots and traps must have degradable hinges and escape vents
            to reduce bycatch and to prevent “ghost fishing” (when a lost
            trap continues to catch fish or lobster).
        -   A moratorium on entry into the fishery.
        -   Recreational anglers are subject to an annual harvest limit,
            minimum fish sizes, possession limits, and open harvest periods.

        Plan](https://safmc.net/fishery-management-plans-amendments/snapper-grouper-fishery-management-plan/).
        -   A small amount of scup is harvested in the South Atlantic. Scup
            are managed as part of a complex with several other porgy
            species.
        -   The Snapper Grouper FMP requires fishermen to have a permit and
            to comply with gear restrictions. The complex is regulated
            through commercial and recreational annual catch limits and
            accountability measures to ensure overfishing does not occur.

    -   Scup grow slowly, up to about 20 inches long and 4 pounds.
    -   They can live a relatively long time, up to about 20 years.
    -   Scup are able to reproduce when they reach age 2, when they’re about
        8 inches long.
    -   They spawn over weedy or sandy areas in southern New England from
        Massachusetts Bay south to the New York Bight from May through
        August, with peak activity in June.
    -   Individual scup spawn once a year.
    -   Most fish spawn at night, but scientists believe scup spawn in the
        morning.
    -   Females release an average of 7,000 eggs, which are fertilized
        externally.
    -   Scup are browsers – they nibble on invertebrates that live on the
        ocean bottom.
    -   They are able to grasp food with their incisors and crush
        hard-shelled animals with their strong molars.
    -   A variety of plankton-eaters—such as medusae, crustaceans, and
        fish—prey on scup larvae.
    -   A number of fish and shorebirds prey on juvenile and adult scup.

    -   Pink shrimp are commonly found on sand, sand-shell, or coral-mud
        bottoms.
    -   Young shrimp live and grow in nursery areas with marsh grasses in
        the South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. These grassy areas offer
        abundant food and shelter.
    -   As pink shrimp grow, they migrate seaward to deeper, saltier water.
        They travel primarily at night, especially around dusk, and bury
        themselves in the bottom substrate during the day.
    -   Smaller pink shrimp remain in estuaries during winter and bury
        themselves deep in the sand or mud to protect themselves from the
        cold temperatures.

  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   In 2017, landings of pink shrimp totaled more than 18.6 million
            pounds and were valued at more than $42.4 million.  
        -   The three species of penaeid shrimp
            ([white](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/white-shrimp), pink,
            and [brown](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/brown-shrimp))
            make up the vast majority of the shrimp harvested in the
            southeast. This fishery is one of the most valuable fisheries in
            the southeastern United States.
        -   Approximately 80 percent of the pink shrimp harvested in the
            United States comes from the west coast of Florida.
        -   Annual harvests of pink shrimp vary considerably from year to
            year, primarily due to environmental conditions. Harvests are
            much lower in years following severe winter weather.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Commercial fishermen harvest shrimp with trawls towed near the
            ocean floor. The nets are wide in the front and taper toward the
            back.
        -   Shrimpers using otter trawl gear in the South Atlantic and Gulf
            of Mexico are required to use sea [turtle excluder devices
            (TEDs)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/bycatch/fishing-gear-turtle-excluder-devices).
        -   Some shrimp trawlers must also install [bycatch reduction
            devices](https://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/labs/mississippi/brd/) behind
            the TED, to reduce finfish bycatch.
        -   Area closures if fishing effort exceeds certain thresholds.
        -   Trawlers in the Gulf of Mexico must have a weak-link in the
            tickler chain, which hangs in front of the net and drags along
            the ocean floor to stir up shrimp from the bottom into the net.
            This weak-link allows the tickler chain to drop away if it gets
            hung up on natural bottom structures.
        -   Fishermen do not trawl in areas with coral reefs and other known
            areas of high-relief to avoid damage to their nets.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Under federal management, there is no recognized recreational
            fishery. Fishing in federal waters requires a permit.
        -   Recreational fishermen catch pink shrimp seasonally and almost
            always in state waters. State regulations vary from state to
            state.

        -   Observers must be carried aboard vessels if selected, to collect
            data on catch, bycatch, fishing effort, and fishing gear.
        -   Managers set catch levels based on historic harvest amounts and
            fishing rates, rather than abundance because pink shrimp are
            short-lived and heavily influenced by environmental factors.
    -   In the Gulf of Mexico, managed under the [Gulf of Mexico Shrimp

            Currently no new permits are being issued to prevent an increase
            in the number of boats participating in the fishery.
        -   Electronic logbooks must be installed and selected fishermen
            must submit trip reports for each fishing trip.
        -   Observers must be carried aboard vessels if selected, to collect
            data on catch, bycatch, fishing effort, and fishing gear.
        -   Each year all shrimping in federal waters off Texas is closed

    -   Pink shrimp grow fairly fast, depending on factors such as water
        temperature and salinity, and can reach over 8 inches in length. 
    -   They have a short life span, usually less than 2 years, and are
        often referred to as an “annual crop.”
    -   Pink shrimp are able to reproduce when they reach about 3.3 inches
        long.
    -   Off North Carolina, they spawn in May through July. In Florida they
        spawn multiple times, peaking from April through July when the water
        is warmest.
    -   Males mate with females and anchor their sperm to the females.
        Females release about 500,000 to 1 million eggs near the ocean
        floor, and the eggs are fertilized as they are released.
    -   Newly hatched shrimp travel to their estuarine nursery habitats in
        late spring and early summer, propelled by shoreward currents.
    -   Shrimp that survive the winter grow rapidly in late winter and early
        spring before returning to the ocean.
    -   Pink shrimp larvae feed on plankton (tiny floating plants and
        animals). Juvenile and adult shrimp are omnivorous, feeding on
        copepods, small mollusks, diatoms, algae, plant detritus, bacterial
        films, slime molds, and yeast.
    -   Sheepshead minnows, water boatmen, and insect larvae eat postlarval
        shrimp, and grass shrimp, killifishes, and blue crabs prey on young
        shrimp.
    -   A wide variety of finfish feed heavily on juvenile and adult shrimp.

  physical_description: |
    -   White shrimp are crustaceans with 10 slender, relatively long
        walking legs and five pairs of swimming legs located on the front
        surface of the abdomen.
    -   Their bodies are light gray, with green coloration on the tail and a
        yellow band on part of the abdomen.
    -   Their carapace is not grooved.
    -   Part of their shell is a well-developed, toothed rostrum that
        extends to or beyond the outer edge of the eyes.
    -   They have longer antennae than other shrimp (2.5 to 3 times longer
        than their body length).
  human_health:
  texture: Slightly more tender than other shrimp, and their shells are somewhat
    softer and easier to peel.

    -   White shrimp commonly inhabit estuaries and coastal areas out to
        about 100 feet offshore.
    -   Young shrimp live and grow in nursery areas with muddy ocean bottoms
        and low to moderate salinity.
    -   White shrimp are often found in association with other shrimp
        species, specifically

  health_benefits: |
    Shrimp is low in saturated fat and is a very good source of protein,
    selenium, and vitamin B12.
  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   In 2017, landings of white shrimp totaled more than 126 million
            pounds and were valued at approximately $260.9 million.
        -   The three species of penaeid shrimp (white,
            [pink](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/pink-shrimp), and
            [brown](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/brown-shrimp)) make
            up the vast majority of the shrimp harvested in the southeast.
            This fishery is one of the most valuable fisheries in the
            southeastern United States.
        -   Almost all of the white shrimp harvested in the United States
            comes from the Gulf of Mexico, mainly from Louisiana and Texas.
            Landings in the South Atlantic are generally spread evenly among
            the states.
        -   Annual harvests of white shrimp vary considerably from year to
            year, primarily due to environmental conditions. Harvests are
            much lower in years following severe winter weather.
        -   White shrimp were the first commercially important shrimp
            species in the United States, dating back to 1709.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Commercial fishermen harvest shrimp with trawls towed near the
            ocean floor. The nets are wide in the front and taper toward the
            back.
        -   Shrimpers using otter trawl gear in the South Atlantic and Gulf
            of Mexico are required to use sea [turtle excluder devices
            (TEDs)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/bycatch/fishing-gear-turtle-excluder-devices).
        -   Some shrimp trawlers must also install [bycatch reduction
            devices](http://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/labs/mississippi/brd/)[ ](https://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/labs/mississippi/brd/)behind
            the TED, to reduce finfish bycatch.
        -   Area closures if fishing effort exceeds certain thresholds.
        -   Trawlers in the Gulf of Mexico must have a weak-link in the
            tickler chain, which hangs in front of the net and drags along
            the ocean floor to stir up shrimp from the bottom into the net.
            This weak-link allows the tickler chain to drop away if it gets
            hung up on natural bottom structures.
        -   Fishermen do not trawl in areas with coral reefs and other known
            areas of high relief to avoid damage to their nets.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Under federal management, there is no recognized recreational
            fishery. Fishing in federal waters requires a permit.
        -   Recreational fishermen catch white shrimp seasonally and almost
            always in state waters. State regulations vary from state to
            state.

        Plan for the South Atlantic
        Region](http://safmc.net/fishery-management-plans-amendments/shrimp-2/):
        -   Permits are needed to harvest shrimp in federal waters.
        -   Fishing trip reports must be submitted for each fishing trip.
        -   Observers must be carried aboard vessels if selected, to collect
            data on catch, bycatch, fishing effort, and fishing gear.
        -   Managers set catch levels based on historic harvest amounts and
            fishing rates, rather than abundance because white shrimp are
            short-lived and heavily influenced by environmental factors.
        -   The white shrimp population can be periodically decimated by
            severe winter cold in the South Atlantic, especially offshore of
            Georgia and South Carolina. Fishery closures may be implemented
            to help protect the remaining adult population so they can
            spawn.
        -   Federal waters close if cold weather reduces the shrimp
            population by 80 percent or more, or if water temperatures fall
            below a critical level.
    -   In the Gulf of Mexico, managed under the [Gulf of Mexico Shrimp
        Fishery Management
        Plan](http://gulfcouncil.org/fishery-management/implemented-plans/shrimp/):
        -   Permits are needed to harvest shrimp in federal waters.
            Currently no new permits are being issued to prevent an increase
            in the number of boats participating in the fishery.
        -   Electronic logbooks must be installed and selected fishermen
            must submit trip reports for each fishing trip.
        -   Observers must be carried aboard vessels if selected, to collect
            data on catch, bycatch, fishing effort, and fishing gear.
        -   Each year all shrimping in federal waters off Texas is closed

  habitat: |
    -   In U.S. waters, two stocks have been identified. The northern stock
        of silver hake inhabits the waters of the Gulf of Maine and Northern
        Georges Bank, and the southern stock inhabits the waters of Southern
        Georges Bank and the Mid-Atlantic Bight.
    -   As nocturnal, semi-pelagic predators, silver hake move up in the
        water column to feed at night, primarily between dusk and midnight.
        They return to rest on the ocean bottom during the day, preferring
        sandy, muddy, or pebbly ocean bottoms.
    -   Silver hake migrate in response to seasonal changes in water
        temperatures, moving toward shallow, warmer waters in the spring.
    -   They spawn in these shallow waters during late spring and early
        summer and then return to deeper waters in the autumn.
    -   Older, larger silver hake prefer deeper waters.
    -   During the summer, portions of both stocks can be found on Georges
        Bank.
    -   During the winter, fish in the northern stock move to deep basins in
        the Gulf of Maine, while fish in the southern stock move to outer
        continental shelf and slope waters.
    -   Silver hake are widely distributed, and have been observed at
        temperature ranges of 2 to 17° C (36 to 63° F) and depth ranges of
        11 to 500 meters (36 to 1,640 feet). However, they are most commonly
        found in temperatures between 7 and 10° C (45 to 50° F).

  harvest: |
    -   Commercial fishery:
        -   The 2016 landings of silver hake totaled more than 16 million
            pounds, primarily coming from the Mid-Atlantic and Southern
            Georges Bank, and were valued at more than $11 million.
        -   Commercial landings of both stocks are only about 15% of
            allowable levels.
        -   Silver hake is part of the small-mesh multispecies management
            unit, along with [red
            hake](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/red-hake) and offshore
            hake, which are collectively referred to as “whiting."
        -   The small-mesh multispecies fishery in the United States
            operates from Maine to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.
    -   Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch:
        -   Fishermen using small-mesh trawl gear to catch silver hake must
            comply with a number of specific requirements to reduce bycatch
            of larger groundfish species.
        -   In designated areas, fishermen are required to use
            raised-footrope trawls, which are designed to keep the net off
            the bottom to reduce bycatch of flatfish and other species.
        -   Discard rates for silver hake are relatively low (10% of the
            northern silver hake landings and 21% of the southern whiting
            and offshore hake landings).
        -   Approximately 60% of the [red
            hake](https://www.fishwatch.gov/profiles/red-hake) caught as
            bycatch in the whiting fishery are discarded.
    -   Recreational fishery:
        -   Recreational fishermen do not target silver hake but sometimes
            catch them incidentally while fishing for other groundfish.
        -   There are currently no restrictions on recreational possession,
            size, or gear type for silver hake caught recreationally in
            federal waters.
        -   There are no specific areas for the recreational fishery.
